 Abstract:  The titanium carbide nanosheets (MXene) hold great potential for fabricating high-performance electronics due to their two-dimensional layered structure, high electrical conductivity, and versatile surface chemistry. However, assembling the small MXene nanosheets into flexible macroscopic films for wearable electronics still remains a challenge. Herein, we report the hierarchical assembling of MXene nanosheets and cellulose nanofibers into high-performance composite films via an electrostatic self-assembly strategy induced by polyethyleneimine. Benefited from the nacre-like microstructure of MXene “bricks” and cellulose nanofibers “mortars” interlocked by polyethyleneimine via hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction, composite films possess integrated superior flexibility, high tensile strength, and stable electrical conductivity, which are advantageous for wearable electronic applications. To provide a proof-of-concept design, a symmetric quasi-solid-state supercapacitor with the as-prepared composite film as electrode is fabricated, which exhibits a specific capacitance of 93.9 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 and almost constant capacitive behavior under different bending states. In addition, the composite film possesses capacities of electrothermal conversion and complete degradation in a hydrogen peroxide solution. These results demonstrate that the electrostatically self-assembled composite films hold great promise in the development of highly flexible, mechanically robust, and environmentally friendly energy storage and conversion devices. © 2022 Zhengzhou University.

 Abstract:  Catalytic doping of magnesium hydride (MgH2) to improve its hydrogen ab/desorption kinetic properties is considered to be an effective and feasible method. In solid-phase catalysis, the extent of contact between the catalyst and the substrate determines the catalytic reaction in a great sense. With large specific surface area and abundant active sites, two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are promising catalysts for MgH2 via providing numerous pathways for the diffusion and dissociation of hydrogen. In this regard, 2D NiMn-based layered double hydroxide and layered metallic oxide (LMO) are designed and introduced into MgH2 to improve its hydrogen storage properties. Simultaneous enhancement in interfacial contact, desorption temperature and kinetics are achieved. The MgH2+9wt% Ni3Mn-LMO composites begin to discharge hydrogen at only 190 °C and 6.10wt% H2 could be charged in 600 s at 150 °C. The activation energy for de/hydrogenation is reduced by 42.43 % and 46.56 %, respectively, compared to pure MgH2. Even at a low operating temperature of 235 °C, the modified system was still able to release 4.44wt% H2 in an hour, which has rarely been reported in previous studies. Microstructure observations and density functional theory calculations revealed that first, the hydrogen pumping effect of Mg2Ni/Mg2NiH4 promotes the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen molecules on the surface of MgH2, second, MnOx drew electrons from Mg2Ni, producing a new Density of State structure with a lower d-bond center. This unique change further strengthens the Mg2Ni/Mg2NiH4 pump effect on MgH2. Our work indicates that the application of 2D metal-based catalysts is a feasible and promising approach towards MgH2 for solid-state hydrogen storage to meet technical and scientific requirements. © 2024

 Abstract:  Developing safer and more efficient hydrogen storage technology is a pivotal step to realizing the hydrogen economy. Owing to the lightweight, high hydrogen storage density and abundant reserves, MgH2 has been widely studied as one of the most promising solid-state hydrogen storage materials. However, defects such as stable thermodynamics, sluggish kinetics and rapid capacity decay have seriously hindered its practical application.

 Abstract:  MgH2, as one of the typical solid-state hydrogen storage materials, has attracted extensive attention. However, the slow kinetics and poor cycle stability limit its application. In this work, LiBH4 and YNi5 alloy were co-added as additives to MgH2 via ball milling, thereby realizing an excellent dehydrogenation performance and good cycle stability at 300 °C. The MgH2-0.04LiBH4-0.01YNi5 composite can release 7 wt.% of hydrogen in around 10 min at 300 °C and still have a reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 6.42 wt.% after 110 cycles, with a capacity retention rate as high as 90.3 % based on the second dehydrogenation capacity. The FTIR results show that LiBH4 can reversibly absorb and desorb hydrogen throughout the hydrogen ab/desorption process, which contributes a portion of the reversible hydrogen storage capacity to the MgH2-0.04LiBH4-0.01YNi5 composite. Due to the small amount of LiBH4 and YNi5, the dehydrogenation activation energy of MgH2 did not decrease significantly, nor did the dehydrogenation enthalpy (∆H) change. However, the MgNi3B2 and in-situ formed YH3 during the hydrogen absorption/desorption cycles is not only beneficial to the improvement of the kinetics performance for MgH2 but also improves its cycle stability. This work provides a straightforward method for developing high reversible hydrogen capacity on Mg-based hydrogen storage materials with moderate kinetic performance. © 2023

 Abstract:  Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is an attractive strategy to convert solar energy to hydrogen. However, the lifetime of PEC devices is restricted by the photocorrosion of semiconductors and the instability of co-catalysts. Herein, we report a feasible in situ inherent cross-linking method for stabilizing semiconductors that uses a CoFe-dispersed polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogel as a transparent protector. The CoFe-PAM hydrogel protected BiVO4 (BVO) photoanode reached a photocurrent density of 5.7 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5G illumination with good stability. The PAM hydrogel network improved the loading of Fe sites while enabling the retention of more CoFe co-catalysts and increasing the electron density of the reaction active sites, further improving the PEC performance and stability. More importantly, by tuning the polymerization network, we pioneer the use of quasi-solid-state electrolytes in photoelectrochemistry, where the high concentration of ionic solvent in the PAM hydrogel ensures effective charge transport and good water storage owing to the hydrophilic and porous structure of the hydrogel.

 Abstract:  MgH2 has been attracted extensive attention because of its superior hydrogen storage performance and good reversibility. Further improvement of its kinetics and thermodynamic performances is needed to achieve widespread application. This article investigated the hydrogen storage properties of the thermodynamic optimized Mg-TiCrV hydrogen storage composite modified by layered Ti3C2 materials containing different 3d transition metal particles (Fe, Co, Ni). Mg-TiCrV/Ti3C2-X (X = Fe, Co, Ni) composites can absorb more than 5.30 wt% hydrogen within 1 min at 453 K under 3 MPa hydrogen pressure, and desorb more than 5.25 wt% hydrogen within 60 min at 543 K to 0.1 MPa. In particular, Mg-TiCrV/Ti3C2-Ni composite exhibited the best hydrogen storage properties, which can desorb 4.98 wt% hydrogen within 60 min at 523 K to 0.1 MPa hydrogen pressure and absorb 5.80 wt% hydrogen within 1 min at 453 K under 3 MPa hydrogen pressure.

 Abstract:  The 0.55LiBH4-0.45Mg(BH4)2 (LMBH) eutectic composite is promising for solid-state hydrogen storage, as it exhibits a high hydrogen capacity and a very low initial dehydrogenation temperature. However, its main hydrogen release steps still require higher temperatures. In the present study, few-layer Ti2C has been synthesized and utilized as catalysts in the LMBH. Compositing LMBH with varying amounts of Ti2C (10, 20, 30, and 40 wt%) results in low initial dehydrogenation temperatures (164–110 °C), fast desorption rates and high hydrogen capacities (7.5–10.5 wt%) at a low temperature of 260 °C. The LMBH-30Ti2C composite yields 6.5 wt% H2 even at as low as 200 °C. Additionally, the LMBH-30Ti2C composite could reversibly store 3.5 wt% H2 during the second to fourth dehydrogenation cycles without degradation. The outstanding hydrogen storage performance could be attributed to decomposition driven by reactions between high-valence Ti ions and LMBH, the in-situ formation of the active metal Ti catalyst, and the prevention of aggregation in the Ti2C-doped LMBH. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Herein, a novel approach by designing Schottky-structured CoNi nano-alloys were introduced. After compositing with MgH2, its initial hydrogen absorption started at a low temperature of 40 °C. At a temperature of 300 °C, 6.5 wt% of H2 was released in only 10 min. Furthermore, the kinetic analysis revealed a pivotal transformation in the control model for dehydrogenation of MgH2, shifted from surface penetration to diffusion at a moderate temperature of 250 °C with the introduction of CoNi-CoO@rGO. After modification, the activation energy for hydrogen de/absorption decreased from 116 kJ/mol and 79.39 kJ/mol, to 66 kJ/mol and 54.39 kJ/mol, respectively. It is noteworthy that the CoNi-CoO@rGO-modified MgH2 exhibited excellent cycling performance, retained an impressive hydrogen storage capacity of 97% after 20 cycles at 300 °C. The innovation of this work lies in the following three aspects: 1) the uniform distribution of CoNi-CoO@rGO nanoparticles on the surface of MgH2 significantly enhanced the contact area and promoted the catalytic activity, 2) the synergistic effect between Mg2Co-Mg2CoH5 and Mg2Ni-Mg2NiH4 attenuate the intensity of the Mg-H bond and quickened the post-discharge of MgH2, 3) the incorporation of a CoO-induced Schottky structure accelerated the H transfer in MgH2 and improved the hydrogen absorption and release efficiency. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are a promising option for long-duration energy storage (LDES) due to their stability, scalability, and potential reversibility. However, solid-state and non-aqueous flow batteries have low safety and low conductivity, while aqueous systems using vanadium and zinc are expensive and have low power and energy densities, limiting their industrial application. An approach to lower capital cost and improve scalability is to utilize cheap Earth-abundant metals such as iron (Fe). Nevertheless, all-iron RFBs have many complications, involving voltage loss from ohmic resistance, side reactions such as hydrogen evolution, oxidation, and most significantly electrode plating, and dendrite growth. To address these issues, researchers have begun to examine the effects of various alterations to all-iron RFBs, such as adding organic ligands to form Fe complexes and using a slurry electrode instead of common materials such as graphite or platinum rods. Overall, progress in improving aqueous all-iron RFBs is at its infant stage, and new strategies must be introduced, such as the utilization of nanoparticles, which can limit dendrite growth while increasing storage capacity.

 Abstract:  NaH and LiH are theoretically capable of storing hydrogen, but several challenges remain to be overcome before they can be widely used for hydrogen storage. In this study, LiH and NaH were ball-milled and the effect of surface area and hydrogen pressure on hydrogen storage capacity was investigated using the solid-state hydrogen storage method. XRD patterns and Raman spectra show significant shifts in main peak positions of LiH and NaH after hydrogen adsorption. BET analysis shows a significant increase in the specific surface area of LiH and NaH from 6.25 m2/g to 12.35 m2/g and from 1.34 m2/g to 2.33 m2/g respectively due to ball milling. The FTIR spectra showed more bonds in the 400–1200 cm⁻1 fingerprint region after storing hydrogen in LiH and NaH. This suggests structural changes with enhanced bond bending due to hydrogen. At 9 bar pressure, LiH and NaH exhibited excellent hydrogen storage, with ball-milled LiH reaching about 3.55 wt% and 652 sccm, and NaH achieving approximately 1.58 wt% and 291 sccm. These results highlight the significant influence of surface area and hydrogen pressure on hydrogen storage potential. Incorporating the storage potential within the evaluation of PEM fuel cell performance, we suggest that an increased storage capacity directly corresponds to an augmented power density. The analysis of power density over time revealed that the hydrogen adsorbed ball-milled LiH exhibited the highest power density, peaking at 0.075 Wcm−2 over the long term. In contrast, LiH displayed a lower power density (0.025 Wcm−2) while maintaining its long-term performance. The hydrogen adsorbed NaH and hydrogen adsorbed ball-milled NaH displayed power densities 0.050 Wcm−2 and 0.073 Wcm−2, respectively, but they showed short-term performance. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

 Abstract:  The rechargeable aqueous Zn ion battery (AZIB) is considered a promising candidate for future energy storage applications due to its intrinsic safety features and low cost. However, Zn dendrites and side reactions (e.g., corrosion, hydrogen evolution reaction, and inactive side product (Zn hydroxide sulfate) formation) at the Zn metal anode have been serious obstacles to realizing a satisfactory AZIB performance. The application of gel electrolytes is a common strategy for suppressing these problems, but the normally used highly cross-linked polymer matrix (e.g., polyacrylamide (PAM)) brings additional difficulties for battery assembly and recycling. Herein, we have developed a gel electrolyte for Zn metal anode stabilization, where a peptide matrix, a highly biocompatible material, is used for gel construction. Various experiments and simulations elucidate the sulfate anion-assisted self-assembly gel formation and its effect in stabilizing Zn metal anodes. Unlike polymer gel electrolytes, the peptide gel electrolyte can reversibly transform between gel and liquid states, thus facilitating the gel-involved battery assembly and recycling. Furthermore, the peptide gel electrolyte provides fast Zn ion diffusion (comparable to conventional liquid electrolyte) while suppressing side reactions and dendrite growth, thus achieving highly stable Zn metal anodes as validated in various cell configurations.

Electronic band structures and density of states reveal that these hydrides are direct bandgap semiconductors. Also, thermoelectric properties like thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, specific heat capacity, Seebeck coefficient, Hall coefficient and carrier concentration are investigated using BoltzTraP software. In addition, the elastic constants have been calculated, and the mechanical properties such as bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio have been calculated using these elastic constants.

 Abstract:  Interface storage is an exciting mechanism for electrode materials to obtain high-energy and high-power densities simultaneously. However, constructing suitable and abundant interfaces in composites to achieve interface-dominated storage is greatly challenging. Here, it is demonstrated for the first time that interface-dominated Zn2+ storage can be realized in the hydrogen-bonding (H-bonding) interface between vanadium oxide (VOx) and graphene oxide (GO). This interface featuring reversibility, universality, self-healing nature, and high per-volume concentration can store more Zn2+ faster than the bulk by decoupling transport and storage of Zn2+ and electrons through reversible break/reconstruction of the interfacial N···H─O bonds. Density functional theory calculations reveal that an appropriate number of N···H─O bonds is crucial for maintaining high reversibility of interface storage. Additionally, the presence of carbon vacancies in the GO plane near the interfacial bonds facilitates an expansion of the interface storage limitation. Finally, it is demonstrated that intercalation pseudocapacitance is the nature of interface storage, which circumvents the solid-state diffusion limitation in the bulk and achieves a high level of pseudocapacitive storage in the interface (464 and 126 mAh g−1 at 0.1 and 10.0 A g−1, respectively).

 Abstract:  Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are one of the most promising next-generation energy storage systems due to their ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity. However, the sluggish redox kinetics and shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide of sulfur cathodes remain obstacles to their development. Herein, we synthesize a thin laminar composite TpPa-SO3H/2-Methylol-15-crown-5 solid-state electrolyte (TpPa-SO3H/15-C-5-OH SSE) by encapsulating the crown ether into nanoscale pores (1.2 nm) of TpPa-SO3H covalent organic framework (COF) through low-pressure filtration. Importantly, the hydrogen-bonding interaction between TpPa-SO3H COF and 15-C-5-OH largely enhances the stable existence of 15-C-5-OH in pores of TpPa-SO3H COF. The 15-C-5-OH confined in pores of TpPa-SO3H COF can form a long-range ordered cavity channel for effective Li+ transport. This endows TpPa-SO3H/15-C-5-OH SSE with high ionic conductivity of 1.31 × 10-5 S cm-1 at 30 °C and satisfactory Li+ transference number (tLi+) of 0.75. In addition, the negative charge of the sulfonate group on the TpPa-SO3H COF can repel the polysulfide anions efficiently through an electrostatic repulsion interaction, thereby blocking the migration of polysulfide. As a result, the Li-S battery with TpPa-SO3H/15-C-5-OH SSE presents superior cycling stability, which preserves a capacity of 739.9 mA h g-1 with a retention of 82.9% after 400 cycles at 60 and 0.5C. © 2024 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Magnesium hydride is one of the most promising solid-state hydrogen storage materials for on-board application. Hydrogen desorption from MgH2 is accompanied by the formation of the Mg/MgH2 interfaces, which may play a key role in the further dehydrogenation process. In this work, first-principles calculations have been used to understand the dehydrogenation properties of the Mg(0001)/MgH2(110) interface. It is found that the Mg(0001)/MgH2(110) interface can weaken the Mg–H bond. The removal energies for hydrogen atoms in the interface zone are significantly lower compared to those of bulk MgH2. In terms of H mobility, hydrogen diffusion within the interface as well as into the Mg matrix is considered. The calculated energy barriers reveal that the migration of hydrogen atoms in the interface zone is easier than that in the bulk MgH2. Based on the hydrogen removal energies and diffusion barriers, we conclude that the formation of the Mg(0001)/MgH2(110) interface facilitates the dehydrogenation process of magnesium hydride. © 2024 The Authors

 Abstract:  Two dimensional materials have received increasing recognition for their utility in electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices, as well as for self-powered systems. In this work, we are reporting the trifunctional electrochemical properties (such as energy-storage, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER)) of WSe2 nanosheets (prepared by a solvothermal method) towards the development of a self-powered system for uninterrupted hydrogen (H2) production. First, we have examined the energy storage properties of the WSe2 nanosheets in the form of flexible solid-state supercapacitor (FSSC) that shows the presence of ion-intercalation pseudocapacitance in the WSe2 nanosheets. The fabricated WSe2 FSSC possess a high device capacitance, energy density, and power density with 119% capacitance retention over 5,000 cycles. Second, we explored the electrocatalytic properties of WSe2 nanosheets that indicated they possess effective HER and OER properties with low overpotential (115 mV for HER and 312 mV for OER), respectively. Finally, a proof-of-concept self-powered system comprising a solar cell, WSe2 FSSC, and lab-scale WSe2 electrolyzer (with a low overpotential of 1.604 V at 10 mA cm−2) was demonstrated to overcome the power fluctuation issues for effective and uninterrupted H2 production. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

 Abstract:  Aqueous aluminum–air batteries are attracting considerable attention with high theoretical capacity, low-cost and high safety. However, lifespan and safety of the battery are still limited by the inevitable hydrogen evolution reaction on the metal aluminum anode and electrolyte leakage. Herein, for the first time, a clay-based quasi-solid-state electrolyte is proposed to address such issues, which has excellent compatibility and a liquid-like ionic conductivity. The clay with uniform pore channels facilitates aluminum ions uniform stripping and reduces the activity of free H2O molecules by reconstructing hydrogen bonds network, thus suppressing the self-corrosion of aluminum anode. As a result, the fabricated aluminum–air battery achieves the highest energy density of 4.56 KWh kg−1 with liquid-like operating voltage of 1.65 V and outstanding specific capacity of 2765 mAh g−1, superior to those reported aluminum–air batteries. The principle of constructing quasi-solid-state electrolyte using low-cost clay may further promote the commercialization of aluminum–air batteries and provide a new insight into electrolyte design for aqueous energy storage system. © 2023 The Authors.

 Abstract:  The development of alloys that are hydrogenated and dehydrogenated quickly and actively at room temperature is a challenge for the safe and compact storage of hydrogen. In this study, a new high-entropy alloy (HEA) with AB-type configuration (A: hydride-forming elements, B: inert-to-hydrogen elements) was designed by considering valence electron concentration, electronegativity difference and atomic-size mismatch of elements.

 Abstract:  In order to investigate the viability of carbon dioxide (CO2) storage in seawater, molecular dynamics techniques were employed to study the dynamic evolution of CO2 hydrate in saline water. The simulation was conducted under specific conditions: a temperature of 275 K, a pressure of 10 MPa and a simulated marine environment achieved using a 3.4 wt% sodium chloride (NaCl) solution. The total simulation time was 1000 ns. The results of the simulation indicate that the pre-existence of CO2 hydrate crystals as seeds leads to rapid growth of CO2 hydrate. However, analysis of the F3 and F4 order parameters reveals that the hydrate does not meet the standard values of the perfect structure I (sI) type, confirming the existence of an imperfect structure during the simulation. Additionally, the changes in the number of different phase states of water molecules during the hydrate growth process shows that there are always some liquid water molecules, which means some water molecules fail to form solid water cages. Further investigation suggests that the presence of Na+ and Clhampers the hydrogen bonds between water molecules, resulting in incomplete cage structures. By analyzing the density variations in the system, it is observed that CO2 hydrate, with a density of around 1.133 g cm- 3, forms rapidly, surpassing the average density of seawater. This density increase facilitates the efficient and swift containment of CO2 on the seabed, thereby supporting the feasibility of the CO2 storage theory. © 2023 International Union of Crystallography.

 Abstract:  Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) gain attention as promising energy storage devices due to their high safety. However, the narrow electrochemical window and unfavorable side reactions induced by water decomposition restrict their development. Thus, confining water activity to enhance stability and enlarge the electrochemical window is required. Herein, a 2.9 m (mol kgsolvent−1) Zn(ClO4)2−CO(NH2)2−H2O ternary aqueous eutectic electrolyte is prepared with restricted water activity at room temperature. The strong intermolecular interactions between CO(NH2)2 and H2O decrease the free H2O molecules and reduce their activity to suppress the parasitic reactions. Compared to conventional aqueous electrolytes, this urea-modified electrolyte exhibits similar ionic conductivity (6.83 mS cm−1) and viscosity (29.5 mPa s) but with a significantly expanded electrochemical stability window (2.6 V) than the conventional one (1.7 V). Additionally, the preferential adsorption and reduction of urea molecules on the zinc surface mediate the formation of an organic solid electrolyte interphase, which passivates the anode and facilitates homogeneous zinc deposition. As a result, this ternary aqueous electrolyte enables high-voltage zinc/vanadium batteries with a capacity of 125 mAh g−1 for 300 cycles at 5 A g−1. This finding demonstrates a low-cost and practicable approach for realizing stable aqueous zinc-ion batteries with an enlarged electrochemical stability window. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

 Abstract:  Solid oxide cells (SOCs) can operate in fuel cell and electrolysis mode. This option allows for production of electricity and heat from a green fuel in fuel cell mode and for storage of electricity as gas or use as fuel in electrolysis mode. Demonstration of reversible SOCs has progressed over the last few years. Increase of lifetime and reduction of costs are major factors for successful commercialization. In metal supported SOCs (MSCs) the thickest layer in the cell, the support layer of a few hundred μm, uses metal instead of Ni/YSZ cermet as in state-of-the-art (SoA) fuel electrode supported cells, thereby enabling a significant cost reduction. The present study investigates SoA Ni/YSZ SOCs and MSCs, fabricated by tape casting, lamination, and screen-printing, in reversible operation at 650 °C in 50/50 steam/hydrogen. In the initial few hundred hours, the degradation rate in electrolysis mode is smaller on a MSC compared to a SoA Ni/YSZ cell, while they are comparable in fuel cell mode. According to electrochemical impedance evaluation, the degradation is due to a simultaneous increase of the serial and polarization resistances in the MSC, while it is mainly due to an increase of the polarization resistance in the SoA cell. © 2024 The Author(s).

 Abstract:  In this study, we have fabricated stainless steel mesh with columnar super-hydrophobic boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) through the ‘gas-liquid-solid’ mechanism annealing method. We employed iron (Fe) powder as the catalyst and utilized boron (B) and boron oxide (B2O3) as the raw materials. The synthesis took place within a tubular furnace, operating under an NH3 atmosphere at a temperature of 1250C∘. The contact angle of water droplets on the experimental surface measures approximately 150∘, while the sliding angle is approximately 3∘. In the next place, the laboratory carried out a series of experiments on the tensile properties, corrosion resistance, and erosion resistance of the prepared samples. The experimental results showed that the sample material had good mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. In addition, the erosion resistance test results showed that the sample material even at high speed (2800 rpm/min). After washing the sample for 5 min, the surface of the material still has good wettability (contact angle is 136.49∘). Finally, droplet bouncing experiments have demonstrated that the adhesion force on the surface of the boron nitride nanotube stainless steel mesh is notably minimal, indicating its substantial hydrophobic properties. Additionally, we conducted an investigation into the wetting interaction between droplets and the surface of the boron nitride nanotube stainless steel mesh. By applying the Wenzel and Cassie formulas and considering the pertinent geometric parameters of the material surface, we theoretically elucidated that, upon contact, the droplets assume a ‘Cassie’ state on the surface of the super-hydrophobic boron nitride nanotube stainless steel mesh. The research results show that the superhydrophobic boron nitride nanotube stainless steel mesh has broad application prospects in the fields of hydrogen storage, sewage treatment and oil-water separation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  For ever-growing energy demand, it is the imperative of time to develop advanced electrolyte materials which are compatible with Li + ion mobility in Lithium based batteries. In this study, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-LiNO3-Formamide (PLF) membrane complex has been developed for cost effective and mass fabrication of Li ion based energy storage devices. Improved Li + ion conducting PVA based polymer electrolytes in seven different PVA and LiNO3 blend compositions were prepared and characterized. Incorporation of Formamide (0.5 g) as plasticizer in the PVA-LiNO3 polymer matrix leads to a remarkable improvement in ionic conductivity (4.18 × 10−4 Scm−1) for a 0.27 g of LiNO3 concentration at ambient temperature. Improvement in Li conductivity is due to change in crystalline nature as a consequence of PVA O-H—O intra/inter molecular H-bonding destabilization. Investigation on the trend of activation energy as a function of dopant concentration indicates that the activation energy decreases up to 0.27 g of LiNO3. Lowest activation energy 0.21 eV is observed for this concentration. More interestingly, improved Lithium Transference Number (LITN) of 0.437 is obtained through Bruce-Vincent approach for the plasticized optimum conducting membrane (PLF4–0.27 g LiNO3 concentration) which is better than that of the commercially available Li batteries. Underlying molecular level interactions in the models of PVA and its complexes were explored using M05-2×/6–31 + G (d,f) levels of theory and NCI analysis. From the least interaction energy of PVA-Formamide complex, it is inferred that metal-Oxygen coordination contributes much for the stabilization of PVA-LiNO3-Formamide, PVA-LiNO3, Formamide-LiNO3 complexes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Rechargeable Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs), prospective candidates for broad-scale energy storage, still encounter many challenges such as hydrogen evolution corrosion, Zn dendrite growth, and capacity fading. Therefore, one specific strategy for tuning the internal structure of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) via organic additives is proposed to address these urgent bottlenecks simultaneously. With trimethyl phosphate (TMP) addition, the coordination environment of Zn2+ in SPEs is altered and exists as Zn2+(TMP)x(OTf−)y coordinated molecules. Meanwhile, the strong interaction between TMP and Zn enables the preferential growth of Zn(002) planes during electrodeposition, which is proved based on first-principles calculations, finite element simulations, and multiple in situ characterizations. Such excellent interfacial engineering in situ forms the solid electrolyte interface rich in Zn3(PO4)2 fast ion conductor and guarantees one ultra-long cycle life for more than 6000 h in a Zn|Zn symmetric cell at 0.1 mA cm−2. Moreover, the universality of TMP-modified SPEs shows 1000 times stable cycling of VO2(B)|Zn full cells at 1 A g−1 under 0 °C with 95.24% capacity retention, which satisfies potential applications of wide-ranging energy storage based on solid-state ZIBs. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen barrier coatings are important for future hydrogen economy to enable materials for applications in hydrogen tanks. In the present study, coatings consisting of amorphous Al2O3 (≈100 nm) synthesized by plasma ion-assisted deposition on top of crystalline metallic Al (≈100 nm) are exposed to 300 bar hydrogen pressure at 673 K for 6 days. This is done to mimic and accelerate conditions in hydrogen storage containers for metallic hydrides. They remain intact after such harsh conditions, although changes do occur. Blister-like features are observed consisting of a buckled oxide layer while the metallic Al layer underneath is retracted. As these features are also found for coatings annealed under 1 bar Ar atmosphere it is concluded that they are not related to the formation of gas bubbles but they form due to solid-state dewetting. This is different to literature observation where H2 bubbles are reported as a consequence of interface diffusion of H/H+ species present due to the initial precursor used for film deposition. The mechanical properties of the coatings, which are evaluated from nanoindentation load–displacement curves, change only moderately. Overall, the study shows that Al2O3|Al coatings are suitable candidates to prevent hydrogen ingress, but dewetting due to long-term exposure at elevated temperatures must be prevented. © 2023 The Authors.

 Abstract:  The poor reversibility of Zn metal anodes arising from water-induced parasitic reactions poses a significant challenge to the practical applications of aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, a novel quasi-solid-state “water-in-swelling-clay” electrolyte (WiSCE) containing zinc sulfate and swelling clay, bentonite (BT), is designed to enable highly reversible Zn metal anodes. AZIB full cells based on the WiSCE exhibit excellent cyclic stability at various current densities, long shelf life, low self-discharge rate, and outstanding high-temperature adaptability. Particularly, the capacity of WiSCE-based AZIB full cells retains 90.47% after 200 cycles at 0.1 A g−1, 96.64% after 2000 cycles at 1 A g−1, and 88.29% after 5000 cycles at 3 A g−1. Detailed density functional theory calculations show that strong hydrogen bonds are formed between BT and water molecules in the WiSCE. Thus, water molecules are strongly confined by BT, particularly within the interlayers, which significantly inhibits water-induced parasitic reactions and greatly improves cyclic stability. Compared to the state-of-the-art “water-in-salt” electrolytes, the WiSCE can provide a significantly higher capacity at the full-cell level with a substantially reduced cost, which is promising for the design of next-generation high-performance AZIBs.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen is regarded as one of the most promising energy sources of the future, due to its low-cost, zero-pollution, and high-heat value. Nevertheless, traditional methods of storing hydrogen are commonly accompanied by the risk of leaks and explosions, so how to store and transport hydrogen safely and efficiently is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Solid-state hydrogen storage is the most attractive way to store hydrogen in nanomaterials by chemical or physical adsorption, which has the advantages of high energy density and good safety. Here, a rational Ni-Zn bimetallic MOF has been constructed by a straightforward synthetic technique, in which the Zn atom was partially replaced by the Ni atom. The micropore rate of the Ni-Zn bimetallic MOFs is higher than that of ZIF-8. In addition, the presence of Ni provides more unsaturated metal sites and strengthens the bonding between hydrogen molecules and Ni, effectively improving the hydrogen storage capacity of Ni-Zn bimetallic MOFs.

 Abstract:  Carboxylic acid-based natural deep eutectic solvents (CA-NADES), comprising acetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, and malic acid as the hydrogen bond donors (HBD), and choline chloride as the hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), were prepared at different molar ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 2:1, and 3:1). The viscosity and rheological properties of the CA-NADES were influenced by temperature, water content, molar ratios, the number of functional groups present in the carboxylic acid, and the state of the carboxylic acid at room temperature. The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the various prepared NADES revealed the formation of new hydrogen bonds, and the structural features of the pure compounds were retained in the CA-NADES. In addition, the CA-NADES coupled with ultrasound-assisted extraction technique (UAE) were used for the extraction of bioactive compounds from date seed powder (DSP). The optimized parameters were molar ratio, extraction time, and solid-to-solvent ratio. The highest extraction efficiency of the CA-NADES was observed with carboxylic acid containing a single carboxylic acid functional group, in the order of lactic acid > acetic acid > citric acid > malic acid. Furthermore, DSP NADES-based extracts were stored under five different conditions (-20 °C, 4 °C, 37 °C, dark, and light). Similarly, freshly prepared CA-NADES were stored for 45 days to investigate any changes in physicochemical properties and extraction efficacy during the storage period. The result revealed that CA-NADES with multiple functional groups (citric and malic acid) retained more bioactive compounds (TPC) during the storage at −20 °C and 4 °C, and also maintained their extraction potentials compared to the CA-NADES with a single functional group. The outcomes of this study provided a broad understanding of the relationship between the physicochemical characteristics of the various CA-NADES, their storage stability, and extraction efficiency, which could be a useful tool for industrial applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Inert atmosphere is normally necessary for fabrication of solid composite electrolytes (SCEs) as a crucial part of solid-state Li-metal batteries in order to avoid undesirable reactions induced by ambient moisture. Herein, we developed an air-processable technique to fabricate SCEs by employing LiCF3SO3 (LiOTf) as the Li salt, which was combined with Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) as the fast Li-conductor and polyvinylidene difluoroethylene/polyvinyl acetate (PVDF/PVAC) as the polymer matrix. With the assistance of trace H2O dissolved in electrolyte solution, the room-temperature Li+ conductivity of the obtained aSCE reached as high as 5.09 × 10-4 S cm-1, which was over 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the one (iSCE, 1.93 × 10-7 S cm-1) cast by the electrolyte solution prepared in an inert atmosphere. The theoretical calculation results reveal that the oxygen atom of H2O exhibits a high propensity to interact with the Li atom in LiOTf (Li···O), thereby establishing a hydrogen bond with the oxygen atom (H···O) in N,N-dimethylformamide (solvent). Such interactions promoted the dissociation of LiOTf and led to the formation of uniform Li+ transportation channels. Simultaneously, the composition distribution was also altered, resulting in a smoother surface of aSCE and lowered crystallinity of PVDF. On this basis, the LiOTf/LLZTO/PVDF/PVAC solution at 60 °C was directly coated onto the surface of the LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode to fabricate the LFP-aSCE film after drying in an oven. The assembled LFP-aSCE/Li battery wetted by trace sulfolane exhibited an initial Coulombic efficiency of 94.7% and a capacity retention rate of up to 96% at 0.2 C (137 mAh g-1) after 180 cycles and a high capacity of 143.7 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C (150 cycles).

 Abstract:  The inherent thermodynamic and kinetic challenges of Mg/MgH2 hydrogen storage materials pose significant obstacles to their development. Alloying has emerged as a highly promising strategy to overcome these challenges. In this study, we synthesized a series of Mg93–Ni7-x-Six (x = 0.4, 1.6, 5) ternary alloys through microstructure optimization and particle refinement using melting and high energy ball milling techniques. We systematically investigated the effects of varying Ni and Si content on the microstructure and hydrogen storage properties of Mg-Ni-Si alloys. The results demonstrate that variations in Ni and Si content leads to the formation of different types of intermetallic compounds within the alloys, thereby influencing their hydrogen storage properties. Among the tested alloys, Mg93Ni2Si5 exhibits superior activation and hydrogen absorption properties. The enhanced hydrogenation performance can be attributed to the precipitation of the Mg2Si phase resulting from increased Si content, as well as the refinement of the Mg2Ni3Si phase and the increase in eutectic structure Mg+Mg11Ni12Si10. Significantly, the increased intermetallic compounds provide a large number of sites and channels for the nucleation of hydrides as well as the diffusion of hydrogen. During the dehydrogenation process, Ni, serves as the predominant catalytic species, effectively promotes the dissociation of hydrogen and enhances the reaction kinetics. As a result, the hydrogen desorption of the hydrogenated Mg93Ni6.6Si0.4 alloy initiates at 180 °C, with a reduced activation energy of 105.21 kJ/mol. These findings underscore the synergistic and effective roles of Ni and Si elements in enhancing the hydrogen storage properties of Mg-based materials, thus supporting the development of economically viable and promising Mg-based solid-state hydrogen storage materials. © 2024

 Abstract:  Magnesium hydride has great potential for solid-state hydrogen storage. However, high dehydrogenation temperature and sluggish hydrogen absorption and desorption kinetics restrict its on-board automotive application. Hydrogen desorption from MgH2 is accompanied by the formation of Mg/MgH2 interfaces, which may play a key role in the further dehydrogenation process. In this work, first principles methods were used to understand the structural, electronic, energetic and hydrogen diffusion kinetic properties of pure and Ti-doped Mg(0001)/MgH2(110) interfaces. It is found that Ti interface doping can slightly increase the interfacial stability as revealed by the work of adhesion, interface energy and electronic structure. Additionally, for both the pure and Ti-doped Mg(0001)/MgH2(110) interfaces, the removal energies for the H atoms in the interface zone are significantly low compared with that of bulk MgH2. In terms of H mobility, the Ti dopant is beneficial for H atoms migrating from the inner layers to the interface for aggregation. Furthermore, hydrogen desorption from the two interfaces mainly takes place by hydrogen diffusion within the interface rather than across the interface into the Mg matrix, and Ti doping can enhance this process significantly. These theoretical observations for hydrogen diffusion behavior at the interface are further validated by fitting the isothermal dehydrogenation curves of MgH2-Ti with a series of kinetic models. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen (H2) storage, in the form of clathrate hydrates, has emerged as an attractive alternative to classical storage methods like compression or liquefaction. Nevertheless, the sluggish enclathration kinetics along with low gas storage capacities in bulk systems is currently impeding the progress of this technology. To this end, unstirred systems coupled with porous materials have been shown to tackle the aforementioned drawbacks. In line with this approach, the present study explores the use of hydrophobic periodic organosilica nanoparticles, later denoted as hollow ring-PMO (HRPMO), for H2 storage as clathrate hydrates under mild operating conditions (5.56 mol% THF, 7 MPa, and 265-273 K). The surface of the HRPMO nanoparticles was carefully decorated/functionalized with THF-like moieties, which are well-known promoter agents in clathrate formation when applied in classical, homogeneous systems. The study showed that, while the non-functionalized HRPMO can facilitate the formation of binary H2-THF clathrates, the incorporation of surface-bound promotor structures enhances this process. More intriguingly, tuning the concentration of these surface-bound promotor agents on the HRPMO led to a notable effect on solid-state H2 storage capacities. An increase of 3% in H2 storage capacity, equivalent to 0.26 wt%, along with a substantial increase of up to 28% in clathrate growth kinetics, was observed when an optimal loading of 0.14 mmol g−1 of promoter agent was integrated into the HRPMO framework. Overall, the findings from this study highlight that such tuning effects in the solid-state have the potential to significantly boost hydrate formation/growth kinetics and H2 storage capacities, thereby opening new avenues for the ongoing development of H2 clathrates in industrial applications. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Carbon sorbent materials have shown great promise for solid-state hydrogen (H2) storage. Modification of these materials with nitrogen (N) dopants has been undertaken to develop materials that can store H2 at ambient temperatures. In this work density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to systematically probe the influence of curvature on the stability and activity of undoped and N-doped carbon materials toward H binding. Specifically, four models of carbon materials are used: graphene, [5,5] carbon nanotube, [5,5] D5d-C120, and C60, to extract and correlate the thermodynamic properties of active sites with varying degrees of sp2 hybridization (curvature). From the calculations and analysis, it is found that graphitic N-doping is thermodynamically favored on more pyramidal sites with increased curvature. In contrast, it is found that the hydrogen binding energy is weakly affected by curvature and is dominated by electronic effects induced by N-doping.

 Abstract:  Solid-state hydrogen storage materials are safe and lightweight hydrogen carriers. Among the various solid-state hydrogen carriers, hydrogen boride (HB) sheets possess a high gravimetric hydrogen capacity (8.5 wt%). However, heating at high temperatures and/or strong ultraviolet illumination is required to release hydrogen (H2) from HB sheets. In this study, the electrochemical H2 release from HB sheets using a dispersion system in an organic solvent without other proton sources is investigated. H2 molecules are released from the HB sheets under the application of a cathodic potential. The Faradaic efficiency for H2 release from HB sheets reached >90%, and the onset potential for H2 release is −0.445 V versus Ag/Ag+, which is more positive than those from other proton sources, such as water or formic acid, under the same electrochemical conditions. The total electrochemically released H2 in a long-time experiment reached ≈100% of the hydrogen capacity of HB sheets. The H2 release from HB sheets is driven by a small bias; thus, they can be applied as safe and lightweight hydrogen carriers with economical hydrogen release properties. © 2024 The Authors.

 Abstract:  The use of Mg-based materials as solid-state hydrogen storage materials can provide a viable solution to the bottleneck hindering the development of hydrogen energy. However, it is necessary to address their excessively stable thermodynamic properties and sluggish kinetic performances. In this study, we prepared a Ni-N-C ternary nanocomposite (designated as Ni@NC) catalyst using Ni-based metal-organic frameworks (Ni-MOFs) as a precursor for catalytic MgH2 hydrogen storage properties. The Ni@NC catalyst exhibited excellent promotion effects on the hydrogen absorption and desorption kinetics and the cycling stability of the Mg-based materials. Notably, the composite exhibited room-temperature hydrogen absorption initiation and an onset dehydrogenation temperature of 188 °C, with complete hydrogenation achieved after holding at 100 °C for 60 min. After undergoing 100 cycles of absorption/dehydrogenation, the capacity retention rate was 99.5 %. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) test results indicated that the re-hydrogenated MgH2-Ni@NC composites consist of Mg2NiH4 and MgH2, with corresponding dehydrogenation activation energies of 75.2 and 82.9 kJ mol−1 respectively. The mechanism analysis revealed that Ni@NC was uniformly distributed on the MgH2 surface. During dehydrogenation/rehydrogenation, Mg2NiH4/Mg2Ni “hydrogen pumping” by Ni and MgH2/Mg occurred in situ, the presence of N-C effectively inhibited the expansion of MgH2/Mg, and the enhanced charge transfer effect was facilitated by N in the Ni@NC composite, synergistically enhancing the kinetic performance and cycling stability of MgH2. © 2024

 Abstract:  Reduced activation ferrite/martensite (RAFM) steel and V4Cr4Ti alloy are candidate structural materials applicable for blankets with various coolants for fusion reactor. In order to combine their advantages, a solid-state diffusion bonding bimetallic plate was designed to provide for high-temperature strength and neutron-irradiation resistance from the vanadium alloy and corrosion-resistance from the steel. However, brittle intermetallic and carbide layers can be formed during the high-temperature diffusion process, which is detrimental to the mechanical properties of the joint. To understand the mechanisms for a ductile joint, the diffusion bonding was performed at different temperatures by hot isostatic pressing (HIP). Various methods were used for the interfacial analysis, together with shear mechanical test and Vickers hardness test across the interface. The interfacial intermetallics differ significantly from each other with different bonding temperatures. Brittle σ-(Fe, V) intermetallic and continuous V2C carbide layer could be avoided by optimizing the diffusion parameters. The joint bonded at 850 °C shows the optimal ductility with highest shearing strength value of 240 MPa, resulting from the synergetic effects. The dispersed TiC nanoparticles formed at interface would play an important role to improve the mechanical performances of the V4Cr4Ti/CLF-1 joint.

 Abstract:  Magnesium hydrides are promising solid-state hydrogen storage materials due to their high gravimetric hydrogen storage density and low cost. However, the high temperature, slow kinetics, and poor cycle stability hinder the practical application of magnesium hydrides as hydrogen storage materials. Here, amorphous TiO2 was embedded into MgH2 particles as hydrogen conveying channels by atomic layer deposition followed by a ball-milling process to improve their hydrogen adsorption and desorption kinetics. The MgH2 particles embedded with amorphous TiO2 were then wrapped by graphene nanosheets (MgH2-20 nm TiO2@Gra) to enhance their cycle stability. The onset hydrogen desorption temperature of MgH2-20 nm TiO2@Gra has been reduced to 199 °C, which is about 100 °C lower than that of pristine MgH2 (290 °C). MgH2-20 nm TiO2@Gra has been demonstrated to rapidly release 6.04 wt% H2 at 275 °C in 10 min, where only 0.086 wt% H2 was released from pristine MgH2 at 300 °C in 10 min.

 Abstract:  Mg(BH4)2 with several polymorphs, known as a high capacity (14.9 wt.%) hydrogen storage material, has become more intriguing due to the recently found new functions of gas physisorption and ionic conductivity. Here we review the state-of-the-art on the energy related functions of Mg(BH4)2. Mg(BH4)2 tends to form the stable intermediate [B12H12]2− when the dehydrogenation temperature is above 400 °C, the strong B-B bonding of which makes the rehydrogenation condition very harsh.

The porous polymorph γ-Mg(BH4)2 shows attractive gas adsorption properties in view of its unique hydridic surface and pore shape, and potentially can be applied in hydrogen adsorption and Kr/Xe selectivity. A new diffraction-based adsorption methodology was developed to characterize adsorption thermodynamics and kinetics of γ-Mg(BH4)2, providing a novel idea for the characterization of crystalline porous materials.

 Abstract:  The industrial adoption of low-carbon technologies and renewable electricity requires novel tools for electrifying unitary steps and efficient energy storage, such as the catalytic synthesis of valuable chemical carriers. The recently-discovered use of microwaves as an effective reducing agent of solid materials provides a novel framework to improve this chemical-conversion route, thanks to promoting oxygen-vacancy formation and O2-surface exchange at low temperatures. However, many efforts are still required to boost the redox properties and process efficiency. Here, we scrutinise the dynamics and the physicochemical dependencies governing microwave-induced redox transformations on solid-state ion-conducting materials. The reduction is triggered upon a material-dependent induction temperature, leading to a characteristically abrupt rise in electric conductivity. This work reveals that the released O2 yield strongly depends on the material's composition and can be tuned by controlling the gas-environment composition and the intensity of the microwave power. The reduction effect prevails at the grain surface level and, thus, amplifies for fine-grained materials, and this is ascribed to limitations in oxygen-vacancy diffusion across the grain compared to a microwave-enhanced surface evacuation. The precise cyclability and stability of the redox process will enable multiple applications like gas depuration, energy storage, or hydrogen generation in several industrial applications. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Through additional experimentation, we demonstrate that reducing the density of silica hydroxyl groups causes the wall-bound water to return to a liquid state, highlighting the pivotal role of hydroxyl groups in the formation of this unique water layer. Our study offers valuable insights into the properties and behavior of interfacial water on solid surfaces and lays the foundation for potential applications in a wide range of fields, such as energy storage, drug delivery, environmental remediation, biological sample preparation, microfluidics, and nanofluidics. Future research will further explore the properties and behavior of interfacial water on different material surfaces and under various environmental conditions, laying the groundwork for technological innovation in related fields.

 Abstract:  Current hydrogen storage confronts safety and high energy cost challenges. Solid-state hydrogen storage provides an efficient pathway with lower cost and pressure conditions. Here, we perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations measuring the hydrogen storage properties of Mg-decorated CN monolayer. 8Mg@CN structure is confirmed based on energetic and geometric criteria and it can absorb up to 40 H2 molecules, achieving a high gravimetric density of 8.92 wt% over the US Department of Energy (DOE) target. The polarized H2 molecules are proven to be physiosorbed on Mg atoms to guarantee desorption. The electronic properties are studied to illustrate the electrostatic attractions between the H2 molecules and the Mg-decorated CN monolayer. Moreover, the desorption temperatures and adsorption pressures are calculated to illustrate the reversibility of hydrogen storage applications on 8Mg@CN. These results indicate 8Mg@CN could be a promising candidate for hydrogen storage with potentially reversible application. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Solid-state storage of hydrogen molecules in carbon-based light metal single-atom materials is promising to achieve both high hydrogen storage capacity and uptake rate, but there is a lack of fundamental understanding and design principles to guide the rational design of the materials. Here, a theoretical relationship is established between the hydrogen capacity/rate and the structures of the heteroatom-doped-graphene-supported light metal Li single atom materials for high-efficient solid-state hydrogen storage, which is verified by combining spectroscopic characterization, H2 adsorption/desorption measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Based on the DFT calculations, a novel descriptor Φ is developed to correlate the inherent properties of dopants with the hydrogen storage properties, and further to screen out the best dual-doped-graphene-supported light metal Li single-atom hydrogen storage materials.

 Abstract:  Ni-based superalloys are materials utilized in high-performance services that demand excellent corrosion resistance and mechanical properties. Its usages can include fuel storage, gas turbines, petrochemistry, and nuclear reactor components, among others. On the other hand, hydrogen (H), in contact with metallic materials, can cause a phenomenon known as hydrogen embrittlement (HE), and its study related to the superalloys is fundamental. This is related to the analysis of the solubility, diffusivity, and permeability of H and its interaction with the bulk, second-phase particles, grain boundaries, precipitates, and dislocation networks. The aim of this work was mainly to study the effect of chromium (Cr) content on H diffusivity in Ni-based superalloys; additionally, the development of predictive models using artificial intelligence. For this purpose, the permeability test was employed based on the double cell experiment proposed by Devanathan–Stachurski, obtaining the effective diffusion coefficient (Deff), steady-state flux (Jss), and the trap density (NT) for the commercial and experimentally designed and manufactured Ni-based superalloys. The material was characterized with energy-dispersed X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), atomic absorption, CHNS/O chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), brightfield optical microscopy (OM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). On the other hand, predictive models were developed employing artificial neural networks (ANNs) using experimental results as a database. Furthermore, the relative importance of the main parameters related to the H diffusion was calculated. The Deff, Jss, and NT achieved showed relatively higher values considering those reported for Ni alloys and were found in the following orders of magnitude: [1 × 10−8, 1 × 10−11 m2/s], [1 × 10−5, 9 × 10−7 mol/cm2s], and [7 × 1025 traps/m3], respectively. Regarding the predictive models, linear correlation coefficients of 0.96 and 0.80 were reached, corresponding to the Deff and Jss. Due to the results obtained, it was suitable to dismiss the effect of Cr in solid solution on the H diffusion. Finally, the predictive models developed can be considered for the estimation of Deff and Jss as functions of the characterized features. © 2023 by the authors.

 Abstract:  With its high hydrogen content (15.4 wt%), hydrazine borane (HB, N2H4BH3) is a promising hydrogen storage material. It is easy to prepare and does not create harmful substances during the release of hydrogen, making it suitable for research.

 Abstract:  Mg90Ce5Y5 + x wt % Yb2O3 (x = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20) samples were prepared by high energy ball milling. The kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the composites were investigated by XRD, TEM, SEM, EDS and PCT. And all samples were tested for hydrogen absorption and desorption. The Mg90Ce5Y5 + 10 wt % Yb2O3 sample displays the fastest hydrogen uptake rate, namely full hydrogenation takes only 125 min at 473 K. And it can fully dehydrogenate in just 75.6 min at 553 K. In addition, the value of Edes is reduced to 95.5 kJ/mol. The improvement of dynamic performance is due to the change of microstructure: Yb2O3/YbH2, YH2 and CeO2 provide plenty of active sites, and abundant defects and grain boundaries lead to the emergence of many high-energy regions and diffusion channels.

 Abstract:  Practical applications usually require solid conductive hydrogels with outstanding mechanical stability for flexible energy storage devices. Herein, a synergistic strategy of acetic acid induction and salting-out is proposed to achieve strong and tough conductive poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels for flexible solid-state supercapacitors. Acetic acid introduced into the PVA/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) system robbed the hydrogen bonding sites of DMSO bound to the hydroxyl groups of PVA, further encouraging the restoration of intra/inter-chain hydrogen bonds of PVA to form an organic pre-gel. Immersion of the PVA pre-gel in salt solution triggers the salting-out process coupled with solvent exchange, facilitating the structural microdomain densification and homogenization, forming a densely cross-linking network and endowing the synergistic PVA hydrogel with splendid mechanical capabilities (strength of 9.06 MPa, 1763% fracture elongation, and toughness of 85.8 MJ m−3). Attributed to the incorporation of ions, the synergistic PVA hydrogel attains satisfactory ionic conductivity (18.02 mS cm−1). The assembled supercapacitor based on synergistic PVA hydrogels and carbon cloth/polyaniline composite electrodes delivers a prominent areal-specific capacitance of 73.13 mF cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2 and can achieve stable output even under deformation.

 Abstract:  A key challenge to apply aqueous zinc-metal batteries (AZMBs) as next-generation energy storage devices is to eliminate the adverse reactions of hydrogen evolution, especially in low current. Here, superhydrophobic and ionophilic artificial solid electrolyte interface (HI-SEI) on zinc anode is proposed and constructed by enhancing roughness and etching ion channels in universal polysiloxane polymer backbones. The HI-SEI exhibits superhydrophobicity with high contact angle of 151.5° and ionophilicity with low activation energy of 23.97 kJ mol−1. Thus, the HI-SEI isolates Zn metal and solvent water and promotes desolvation kinetics of Zn2+. Besides, the HI-SEI alters the double electric layer structure to form a compact layer hardly any adsorbed solvent water, achieving a small nucleation overpotential of 5 mV and low self-corrosion current density of 0.95 µA cm−2. Moreover, a symmetric cell with HI-SEI@Zn anode has a cycle life of >1330 h at low current of 0.1 mA cm−2. And a full cell with HI-SEI@Zn anode and NaV3O8-1.5H2O cathode provides long cycle life and low capacity degradation (180 mAh g−1 after 1100 cycles). Hopefully, SEI designs based on such a strategy will be able to improve the low-current cycling performance of the next-generation AZMBs. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

 Abstract:  The superior gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen capacities of magnesium hydride (MgH2) make it a promising candidate material for solid-state hydrogen storage. However, the slow kinetics of hydrogen atoms and the high thermodynamic stability of MgH2 hinder its practical application. To address the challenging issue of adsorption–desorption in MgH2, structural engineering involving nanostructuring has been used to improve the hydrogen-storage characteristics of this material. However, although structural engineering and thermal management significantly influence material properties, no microscopic understanding of the heat conduction property of pristine MgH2 exists. Further advances in the thermal engineering of MgH2-based hydrogen-storage materials require a better understanding of heat conduction in pristine MgH2, particularly knowledge of how the crystalline phases of MgH2 depend on the hydrogen concentration and external pressure. This study uses first-principles-based anharmonic lattice dynamics to quantitatively investigate the intrinsic thermal conductivity of heat-carrying phonons in pristine MgH2 with three different crystalline phases α, β, and γ. The results show that the thermal conductivity of MgH2 depends on the crystalline phase and that the magnitude of the thermal conductivity increases in the order α, γ, and β. In contrast, the volumetric heat capacity and mean squared displacements of the constituent atoms are similar for all three phases. Furthermore, as observed for the pressure dependence of phonon transport, increasing the pressure reduces the thermal conductivity of all phases. However, for the γ and β phases, these reductions are relatively moderate because of the competing effects of group velocity and relaxation time, which have opposite dependencies on pressure. Finally, modal analysis indicates that the spectral features of the phonon transport properties under an applied external pressure are comparable to those at atmospheric pressure. These results should help tailor the heat dissipation of MgH2 while maintaining its hydrogen adsorption–desorption performance through structural engineering. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

 Abstract:  This study employs density functional theory (DFT) and density functional tight-binding theory (DFTB) to determine the adsorption properties of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and dihydrogen (H2) in carbophenes functionalized with carboxyl (COOH), amine (NH2), nitro (NO2), and hydroxyl (OH) groups. We demonstrate that carbophenes are promising candidates as adsorbents for these gasses. Carbophenes have larger CO2 and CH4 adsorption energies than other next-generation solid-state capture materials. Yet, the low predicted desorption temperatures mean they can be beneficial as air scrubbers in confined spaces. Functionalized carbophenes have H2 adsorption energies usually observed in metal-containing materials. Further, the predicted desorption temperatures of H2 from carbophenes lie within the DOE Technical Targets for Onboard Hydrogen Storage for Light-Duty Vehicles (DOEHST) operating temperature range. The possibility of tailoring the degree of functionalization in combination with selecting sufficiently open carbophene structures that allow for multiple strong interactions without steric hindrance (crowding) effects, added to the multiplicity of possible functional groups alone or in combination, suggests that these very light materials can be ideal adsorbates for many gases.

 Abstract:  In this work, a trimetallic (Ni/Co/Zn) organic framework (tMOF), synthesized by a solvothermal method, was calcinated at 400 and 600 °C and the final products were used as a support for lipase immobilization. The material annealed at 400 °C (Ni-Co-Zn@400) had an improved surface area (66.01 m2/g) and pore volume (0.194 cm3/g), which showed the highest enzyme loading capacity (301 mg/g) with a specific activity of 0.196 U/mg, and could protect the enzyme against thermal denaturation at 65 °C. The optimal pH and temperature for the lipase were 8.0 and 45 °C but could tolerate pH levels 7.0-8.0 and temperatures 40-60 °C. Moreover, the immobilized enzyme (Ni-Co-Zn@Lipase, Ni-Co-Zn@400@Lipase, or Ni-Co-Zn@600@Lipase) could be recovered and reused for over seven cycles maintaining 80, 90, and 11% of its original activity and maintained a residual activity >90% after 40 storage days. The remarkable thermostability and storage stability of the immobilized lipase suggest that the rigid structure of the support acted as a protective shield against denaturation, while the improved pH tolerance toward the alkaline range indicates a shift in the ionization state attributed to unequal partitioning of hydroxyl and hydrogen ions within the microenvironment of the active site, suggesting that acidic residues may have been involved in forming an enzyme-support bond.

 Abstract:  We report a rational design of luminescent molecular materials that display dynamic behavior in the solid state. Stimuli-responsive porous materials constructed at the molecular level are finding useful applications in sensing, storage, and separation. However, it is challenging to create such materials since the molecules tend to pack closely, preventing the creation of void spaces. To address this challenge, we have invented a letter X-shaped luminescent molecule that exploits quadruple C-H⋯N hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) to construct highly branched 1D assemblies. In polar solvents that can compete with weak H-bonds, the molecule adopts interdigitation rather than 1D assemblies. Regardless of the primary mode of intermolecular interactions, the molecules cannot find shape complementarity with each other, resulting in porous networks held together by weak van der Waals forces. A combination of spectroscopic, single-crystal, and powder X-ray crystallographic studies revealed that one polymorph exhibits reversible crystal-to-crystal transformations that can be triggered by external stimuli and optically read through visually discernible changes in the fluorescence. We further elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of this optical response, which is driven by changes in the molecular conformation and aggregation modes, tilting the alignment angle of the H-bonded substructure. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

With a size of about 10 nm, Cr1:1 presented significant modification impacts on enhancing the hydrogen storage capability of MgH2. Specifically, MgH2 was able to release hydrogen at 200 °C with the addition of Cr1:1, MgH2+10wt% Cr1:1 showed prompt rate of dehydrogenation which could release 5.56 wt% H2 in 20 min at 250 °C, and the activation energy of MgH2 was lowered to 69.77± 3.75 kJ⋅mol−1 by adding Cr1:1. According to the Chou model fitting, the exceptional kinetic performance of the composite was attributable to a rate-controlling step changed from low-speed surface penetration to high-speed diffusion. Furthermore, MgH2+10wt% Cr1:1 was capable of absorbing hydrogen at ambient temperature and the composite could uptake 6 wt% H2 within 8 min at the temperature of 150 °C.

 Abstract:  High thermal stability and sluggish absorption/desorption kinetics are still important limitations for using magnesium hydride (MgH2) as a solid-state hydrogen storage medium. One of the most effective solutions in improving hydrogen storage properties of MgH2 is to introduce a suitable catalyst. Herein, a novel nanoparticulate ZrNi with 10-60 nm in size was successfully prepared by co-precipitation followed by a molten-salt reduction process. The 7 wt % nano-ZrNi-catalyzed MgH2 composite desorbs 6.1 wt % hydrogen starting from ∼178 °C after activation, lowered by 99 °C relative to the pristine MgH2 (∼277 °C). The dehydrided sample rapidly absorbs ∼5.5 wt % H2 when operating at 150 °C for 8 min. The remarkably improved hydrogen storage properties are reasonably ascribed to the in situ formation of ZrH2, ZrNi2, and Mg2NiH4 caused by the disproportionation reaction of nano-ZrNi during the first de-/hydrogenation cycle. These catalytic active species are uniformly dispersed in the MgH2 matrix, thus creating a multielement, multiphase, and multivalent environment, which not only largely favors the breaking and rebonding of H-H bonds and the transfer of electrons between H- and Mg2+ but also provides multiple hydrogen diffusion channels.

 Abstract:  The development of aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) faces significant challenges because of water-induced side reactions arising from the high water activity in aqueous electrolytes. Herein, a quasi-solid-state electrolyte membrane with low water activity is designed based on a laponite (LP) nanoclay for separator-free AZIBs. The mechanically robust LP-based membrane can perform simultaneously as a separator and a quasi-solid-state electrolyte to inhibit dendrite growth and water-induced side reactions at the Zn/electrolyte interface. A combination of density functional theory calculations, theoretical analyses, and experiments ascertains that the water activities associated with self-dissociation, byproduct formation, and electrochemical decomposition could be substantially suppressed when the water molecules are absorbed by LP. This could be attributed to the high water adsorption and hydration capabilities of LP nanocrystals, resulting from the strong Coulombic and hydrogen-binding interactions between water and LP. Most importantly, the separator-free AZIBs exhibit high capacity retention rates of 94.10% after 2,000 cycles at 1 A/g and 86.32% after 10,000 cycles at 3 A/g, along with enhanced durability and record-low voltage decay rates over a 60-day storage period. This work provides a fundamental understanding of water activity and demonstrates that LP nanoclay is promising for ultrastable separator-free AZIBs for practical energy storage applications. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Electrode materials must be rationally designed with morphologies and electroactive sites manipulated through cations’ synergy in bimetal compounds in order to maximize the performance of energy storage devices. Therefore, the present study emphasizes binder-free scalable preparation of cobalt nickel vanadate (CNV) thin films by a facile successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) approach with specific cations (Co:Ni) alternation. Increasing the Ni cation content in the CNV notably transforms its microflower structure comprising nanoflakes (252 nm) into nanoparticles (74 nm). An optimized S-CNV5 thin film cathode with Co:Ni molar ratio of ∼ 0.4:0.6 and a high specific surface area of 340 m2 g−1, provided the excellent specific capacitance (Csp) and capacity (Csc) of 1382 F g−1 and 691 C g−1, respectively at 1 A g−1 current density. A hybrid aqueous supercapacitor (HASc) device with positive and negative electrodes comprising optimized CNV and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), respectively, in a 1 M KOH electrolyte delivered a Csp of 133 F g−1 and a specific energy (SE) of 53 Wh kg−1 at a specific power (SP) of 2261 kW kg−1. Additionally, a fabricated hybrid solid-state supercapacitor (HSSc) device with the same electrodes applying PVA-KOH gel electrolyte displayed a Csp of 119 F g−1, and SE of 46 Wh kg−1 at SP of 1184 W kg−1. This boosted electrochemical activity is due to the synergetic effects of Ni and Co species in the CNV thin film electrodes, emphasizing the potential of CNV electrodes as cathodes in hybrid energy storage devices. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

 Abstract:  Aqueous zinc-iodine battery (AZIB) has the advantage of low cost and high specific capacity but suffer from the soluble polyiodides shuttling and sluggish redox kinetics. Herein, these two limitations are addressed by employing a cathode additive (zirconium hydrogen phosphate, denoted as EI-ZrP) which provides dual functions: an agent for polyiodide confinement, and abundant channels for zinc ion transport. An enlarged crystalline interlayer (from typical 7.5 to 18.3 Å) of the EI-ZrP significantly enhances the ionic conductivity and simultaneously immobilizes polyiodides, leading to an accelerated conversion process. AZIB with EI-ZrP in the iodine cathode exhibits a high capacity retention over 10,000 cycles (with a 0.02‰ decay rate per cycle). Quasi-solid-state Zn-I2 pouch cell has been constructed using hydrogel-paper as separator and EI-ZrP additive, which delivers a high areal capacity under repeated bending. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, the paper battery is integrated to power a wireless flexible pressure sensor system (WFPSS).

 Abstract:  Hydrogen is a promising green fuel carrier that can replace fossil fuels; however, its storage is still a challenge. Carbon-based materials with metal catalysts have recently been the focus of research for solid-state hydrogen storage due to their efficacy and low cost. Here, we report on the exfoliation of expanded graphite (EG) through high shear mixing and probe tip sonication methods to form graphene-based nanomaterial ShEG and sEG, respectively. The exfoliation processes were optimized based on electrochemical capacitance measurements. The exfoliated EG was further functionalized with palladium nanoparticles (Pd-NP) for solid-state hydrogen storage. The prepared graphene-based nanomaterials (ShEG and sEG) and the nanocomposites (Pd-ShEG and Pd-sEG) were characterized with various traditional techniques (e.g., SEM, TEM, EDX, XPS, Raman, XRD) and the advanced high-resolution pair distribution function (HRPDF) analysis. Electrochemical hydrogen uptake and release (QH) were measured, showing that the sEG decorated with Pd-NP (Pd-sEG, 31.05 mC cm−2) and ShEG with Pd-NP (Pd-ShEG, 24.54 mC cm−2) had a notable improvement over Pd-NP (9.87 mC cm−2) and the composite of Pd-EG (14.7 mC cm−2). QH showed a strong linear relationship with an effective surface area to volume ratio, indicating nanoparticle size as a determining factor for hydrogen uptake and release. This work is a promising step toward the design of the high-performance solid-state hydrogen storage devices through mechanical exfoliation of the substrate EG to control nanoparticle size and dispersion. © 2023 by the authors.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen storage in the solid state is considered a key technology for developing commercial applications of hydrogen energy. With the addition of efficient nanocatalysts, magnesium (Mg) is a promising approach for overcoming the threshold for hydrogen storage materials. Mg-Ni-Ti3C2 composites were created in this study by integrating nanoscale nickel (Ni) and Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets with Mg particles using a mechanical ball milling process. Compared with incorporating Ni nanoparticles or Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets alone, the combination of Ni and Ti3C2Tx MXene enhanced the dehydrogenation performance of magnesium hydride (MgH2). The ideal combination of a rapid hydrogen uptake/release rate and high hydrogen storage capability was achieved by properly controlling the proportion of additives. The prepared Mg-2Ni/Ti3C2 composite possessed superior hydrogen storage properties, releasing 3.96 wt % hydrogen at 300 °C, whereas additive-free Mg released almost no hydrogen under the same conditions. Furthermore, Mg-2Ni/Ti3C2 absorbed 3.16 wt % hydrogen even at 275 °C. The Mg-2Ni/Ti3C2 composite exhibited a dehydrogenation activation energy of 75.0 kJ mol-1, which was 60.4 kJ mol-1 less than that of pristine Mg. After 10 cycles, 96.1% of the hydrogen capacity was retained, exhibiting a superior cycling stability. According to the catalytic mechanism study, the surprisingly enhanced hydrogen storage property of MgH2 is attributed to the “hydrogen pump” effect of Mg2Ni/Mg2NiH4 combined with the catalytic, “facilitated hydrogen pump,” and confinement roles of Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous and crystalline organic polymers, which have found usage in various fields. These frameworks are tailorable through the introduction of diverse functionalities into the platform. Indeed, functionality plays a key role in their different applications. However, sometimes functional groups are not compatible with reaction conditions or can compete and interfere with other groups of monomers in the direct synthetic method. Also, pre-synthesis of bulky moieties in COFs can negatively affect crystal formation. To avoid these problems a post-synthetic modification (PSM) approach is a helpful tactic. Also, with the assistance of this strategy porous size can be tunable and stability can be improved without considerable effect on the crystallite. In addition, conductivity, hydrophobicity/ hydrophilicity, and chirality are among the features that can be reformed with this method. In this review, different types of PSM strategies based on recent articles have been divided into four categories: (i) post-functionalization, (ii) post-metalation, (iii) chemical locking, and (iv) host-guest post-modifications. Post-functionalization and chemical locking methods are based on covalent bond formation while in post-metalation and host-guest post-modifications, non-covalent bonds are formed. Also, the potential of these post-modified COFs in energy storage and conversion (lithium-sulfur batteries, hydrogen storage, proton-exchange membrane fuel cells, and water splitting), heterogeneous catalysts, food safety evaluation, gas separation, environmental domains (greenhouse gas capture, radioactive element uptake, and water remediation), and biological applications (drug delivery, biosensors, biomarker capture, chiral column chromatography, and solid-state smart nanochannels) have been discussed. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  The increasing severity of global climate and energy problems has made renewable energy an inevitable choice for achieving a low-carbon society. Hydrogen is regarded as one of the most promising renewable energy due to its excellent characteristics, such as abundant and extensive resources, high calorific value, and non-pollution. How to achieve efficient hydrogen storage is one of the main hot spots of hydrogen energy research. For on-board hydrogen storage systems, which could be used for portable power sources and fuel cell vehicles, how to store hydrogen safely and effectively is one of the most urgent technological bottlenecks to overcome. The solid-state storage based on hydrogen storage materials has the advantages of low hydrogen storage pressure, high energy efficiency, safety and reliability, compared to conventional compressed hydrogen and cryogenic liquid hydrogen storage methods. It may be one of the most promising solutions to solve the above problems. Among the hydrogen storage materials, the lightweight composite hydrides Li–Mg–N–H system holds great promise for vehicular hydrogen storage applications owing to its moderate thermodynamic properties (∆H des ~ 44 kJ mol−1 H2 and ∆S des ~ 112 J mol−1 H2·K) and relatively high hydrogen capacity (~ 5.6 wt%). However, the Li–Mg–N–H material itself has poor cycling performance and a high energy barrier, resulting in a low dehydrogenation rate and high operating temperature. Apart from this, the multi-field coupling of mass and energy transfer also poses a challenge, hindering its on-board applications. In this paper, we present the modification methods and research status of the Li–Mg–N–H system's hydrogen storage materials. The effects of composition modification, nanocrystallization and catalyst addition on the thermal/kinetic properties of hydrogen storage materials in the Li–Mg–N–H system are expounded.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen energy and storage are gaining significant attention due to their potential to address various energy and environmental challenges. The storage of hydrogen in solid-state media is an area of significant interest and research in comparison to compressed gas or liquefied hydrogen storage in high-pressure and large-volume storage tanks. Solid materials can store hydrogen in a condensed form, allowing more hydrogen to be stored within a smaller volume or mass. In addition, solid-state materials offer safer hydrogen storage compared to gaseous or liquid hydrogen where hydrogen is stored at very high pressure (350-700 bar). Extensive research has been carried out on graphene-based materials doped with heteroatoms, showing promise as potential candidates for hydrogen storage. This is attributed to their distinctive properties and improved ability to adsorb hydrogen. Several heteroatoms, such as nitrogen, boron, and sulfur, have been extensively studied for their effects on graphene's hydrogen storage performance. As far as the authors know, there is no critical review reported on heteroatom-doped graphene for hydrogen storage.

 Abstract:  Aqueous sodium-ion batteries (ASIBs) have garnered considerable attention for large-scale energy storage because of inherent safety and the Na abundance. Nonetheless, the solidification of aqueous electrolytes under sub-zero conditions results in diminished ionic conductivity and increased viscosity, hindering the electrochemical performance and versatility of ASIBs. Herein, we introduce a novel freeze-tolerant ASIB using antifreezing ethylene glycol-polyacrylamide-sodium perchlorate hydrogel electrolyte, paired with new couple of Na3MnTi(PO4)3 cathode and Fe-based anode. The addition of ethylene glycol in the electrolyte enhances ionic conductivity at cold temperatures and optimizes electrode capacity by reduced hydrogen bonding within the water molecules and a decline in free water activity. The pronounced interaction between ethylene glycol and water, combined with the cooperative effect of the crosslinked polyacrylamide network, enables the hydrogel electrolyte to effectively suppress water solidification and maintain better water-retaining capability, achieving remarkable mechanical extensibility and good ionic conductivity (2.5 mS cm−1) at − 40 °C. Consequently, the ASIB equipped with hydrogel electrolyte delivers high energy density of 43.6 Wh kg−1 and retains 64 % at − 30 °C. Furthermore, the flexible ASIB demonstrates robust mechanical durability when bent or compressed, efficiently powering electronic devices even at − 30 °C.

 Abstract:  Rechargeable Zinc battery technologies are regarded as viable candidates for large-scale energy storage due to constitutional safety and inexpensive position. Nevertheless, the strong polarity of H2O molecules initiates the deterioration of both zinc metal anode and cathode. At anode side, radical H2O molecules cause side reactions of zinc corrosion, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth. At cathode side, the dissolution of transition metal brings about severe capacity fading of cathodes. Herein, we replace the 90% H2O sheath of Zn2+ solvation with 1,3-propanediol (PDO) molecules to form a lean-water electrolyte, in which the abundant PDO molecules can significantly suppress 99.9% HER and prohibit the Zn dendrite growth, while H2O molecules with a molecular lubrication mechanism enables fast ion transportation. Consequently, at anode side, Zn plating/stripping reversibly processes over 4000 cycles with high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.24% in ZnǀǀCu cell. At cathode side, the decreased water activity and scarce solute-water dissolving surfaces suppress 98.6% dissolution of manganese species. The ZnǀǀMnHCF full cell demonstrates high capacity of 140.7 mAh·g−1 at 0.1 A·g−1 and ultra-long lifespan of 3000 cycles with 85.4% initial capacity retained. More importantly, a 1.4 Ah ZnǀǀMnHCF pouch cell shows excellent lifespan over 150 cycles with charge/discharge run time > 68 days.

The structural investigations of the prepared materials were carried out using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and Raman spectroscopy. These techniques confirmed the successful formation of a new non-stoichiometric solid solution with a pyrochlore structure within the compositional range of 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.33, maintaining a cubic structure with the Fd-3m space group. A slight increase in the lattice parameter, a, was observed with higher substitution levels, x. Quantitative analysis using FullProf software revealed the substitution of Zn2+ ions on both Eu3+ and Ti4+ sites, with non-equivalent proportions, leading to vacancies in the anionic sublattice. Furthermore, the electrochemical hydrogen storage (EHS) capacity of these materials was examined. The pyrochlore solid solution with x = 0.25 exhibited an outstanding discharge capacity of about 1400 mAh/g, surpassing that of other samples. This finding highlights its high potential for hydrogen storage. Consequently, our research yields valuable insights into the synthesis, structural properties, and electrochemical performance of the (1-x) Eu2Ti2O7 – x ZnO solid solution, opening up new possibilities for hydrogen storage. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

 Abstract:  Interfacial behaviours in multiphase systems containing H2 are crucial to underground H2 storage but are not well understood. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to investigate interfacial properties of the H2+H2O and H2+H2O+silica/kerogen systems over a broad range of temperatures (298 - 523 K) and pressures (1 - 160 MPa). The combination of the H2 model with the INTERFACE force field and TIP4P/2005 H2O model can accurately predict the experimental interfacial tensions (IFTs) of the H2+H2O mixture. The IFTs from simulations are also in accordance with predictions from density gradient theory combined with the PC-SAFT equation of state. In general, the IFT decreases with pressure and temperature. However, at relatively high temperatures and pressures, the IFTs increase with pressure. The opposite pressure influence on IFTs can be explained by the inversion of the sign of the relative adsorption of H2. The H2 enrichment in the interfacial regions was identified in density distributions. Meanwhile, the behaviours of contact angles (CAs) in the H2+H2O+silica system are noticeably different from those in the H2+H2O+kerogen system. The H2O CAs for the H2+H2O+silica and H2+H2O+kerogen systems increase with pressure and decrease with temperature. However, the influence of temperature and pressure on these CAs is less pronounced for the H2+H2O+silica system at low temperatures. The behaviours of CAs were understood based on the variations of IFTs in the H2+H2O system (fluid-fluid interaction) and adhesion tensions (fluid-solid interaction). Furthermore, the analysis of the atomic density distributions indicates that the presence of H2 in between the H2O and the silica/kerogen is almost negligible. Nevertheless, the adsorption of H2O on the silica outside the H2O is strong, while less H2O adsorption is seen on the kerogen. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  In contrast to isolated C60 molecular dispersion in solvents, the monolayer C60 networks synthesized by Hou et al. (Nature 2022, 606, 507-510) feature compact nanocages, serving as natural containers for hydrogen storage. The anisotropic lattice and intrinsic local strains induce delocalization of conjugated π orbitals within C60, enabling hydrogen chemisorption without an additional chemical modification. Through first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal the correspondence between chemisorption sites and orbital distributions, determining the orientation of polyhedrons formed by physiosorbed hydrogen molecules. The combination of chemisorption and physisorption processes significantly enhances hydrogen storage capacity in monolayer C60 networks while maintaining the thermodynamic stability of the nanocage structures. Numerical results indicate a maximum internal hydrogen pressure exceeding 116 GPa at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.

 Abstract:  Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is considered as the most potential hydrogen storage material for portable proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) because of its high theoretical hydrogen capacity. However, the slow and poor kinetic stability of hydrogen generation from NaBH4 hydrolysis limits its application. There are two main factors influencing the kinetics stability of hydrogen generation from NaBH4. One factor is that the alkaline by-products (NaBO2) of the hydrolysis reaction can increase the pH of the solution, thus inhibiting the reaction process. It mainly happens in the NaBH4 solution hydrolysis system. Another factor is that the monotonous increase in reaction temperature leads to uncontrollable and unpredictable hydrolysis rates in the solid NaBH4 hydrolysis system. This is due to the excess heat generated from this exothermic reaction in the initial reaction of NaBH4 hydrolysis. In this perspective, we summarize the latest research progress in hydrogen generation from NaBH4 and emphasize the design principles of catalysts for hydrogen generation from NaBH4 solution and solid state NaBH4. The importance of carbon as catalyst support material for NaBH4 hydrolysis is also highlighted. © 2023 The Authors

 Abstract:  The rare combination of metallic conductivity and surface redox activity enables 2D MXenes as versatile charge storage hosts for the design of high-rate electrochemical energy storage devices. However, high charge density metal ions including but not limited to Ca+2 and Mg+2 pose challenges such as sluggish solid-state diffusion and also inhibiting the charge transfer across electrode-electrolyte interfaces. In this work, free-standing hybrid electrode architectures based on 2D titanium carbide-cationic perylene diimide (Ti3C2Tx@cPDI) via supramolecular self-assembly are developed. Secondary bonding interactions such as dipole-dipole and hydrogen bonding between Ti3C2Tx and cPDI are investigated by zeta potential and Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Ti3C2Tx@cPDI free-standing electrodes show typical volumetric capacitance up to 260 F cm−3 in Mg2+ and Ca2+ aqueous electrolytes at charging times scales from 3 minutes to a few seconds.

 Abstract:  The catalytic effect of FeCoNiCrMo high entropy alloy nanosheets on the hydrogen storage performance of magnesium hydride (MgH2) was investigated for the first time in this paper. Experimental results demonstrated that 9wt% FeCoNiCrMo doped MgH2 started to de-hydrogenate at 200°C and discharged up to 5.89wt% hydrogen within 60 min at 325°C. The fully dehydrogenated composite could absorb 3.23wt% hydrogen in 50 min at a temperature as low as 100°C. The calculated de/hydrogenation activation energy values decreased by 44.21%/55.22% compared with MgH2, respectively. Moreover, the composite’s hydrogen capacity dropped only 0.28wt% after 20 cycles, demonstrating remarkable cycling stability. The microstructure analysis verified that the five elements, Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, and Mo, remained stable in the form of high entropy alloy during the cycling process, and synergistically serving as a catalytic union to boost the de/hydrogenation reactions of MgH2. Besides, the FeCoNiCrMo nanosheets had close contact with MgH2, providing numerous non-homogeneous activation sites and diffusion channels for the rapid transfer of hydrogen, thus obtaining a superior catalytic effect. © 2023, University of Science and Technology Beijing.

 Abstract:  Solid-state hydrogen storage has emerged as an efficient and reliable technique to commercialize hydrogen energy on a large scale. Magnesium hydride (MgH2), amongst other materials, shows excellent hydrogen storage capability. However, it suffers from setbacks like sluggish kinetics and high thermodynamic stability. Several studies have shown that doping with suitable materials is an effective method to improve the sorption kinetics. Current work is concerned with doping of MgH2 with perovskite-type ternary metal oxide NaNbO3 at 5,10 & 15 wt% doping concentration via ball milling and study of its sorption properties. Thermal desorption mass spectra (TDMS) with thermogravimetry (TG) and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) validate the optimum doping concentration to be 10 wt% NaNbO3 in MgH2. According to the isothermal hydrogenation plots, 10 wt% catalyzed sample was capable of absorbing 5.29 wt% hydrogen in just 4.2 min at 150ºC which by far outperforms the 2 h milled MgH2 sample which under the same set of conditions absorbs only 0.67 wt% H2. The catalyst starts affecting the absorption rate right from the room temperature whereas the milled sample has minimal absorption throughout the experiment. At room temperature, the average rate of absorption grows by factor 7 which is staggeringly high. The Kissinger analysis reveals activation energy for hydrogen release as 73.12 kJ/mol for 10 wt% doped NaNbO3-MgH2 system while 137.13 kJ/mol for as milled MgH2. The pressure-temperature isotherm (PCI) at four different temperatures gives a quantitative measure of the thermodynamic stability of the system. To fully comprehend the catalytic process, XRD, SEM, and XPS analysis were conducted after each stage of experiment. XPS suggested possible reduction of Nb valance state from + 5 to + 2 due to surface reduction reaction which further accelerated the sorption kinetics due to the electron transfer process. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Nitrogen oxides, NOx, are harmful and should be eliminated to help the clean-up and/or maintenance of the global environment. In recent years, an opportunity to utilize the reactive nitrogen compound NO2 in the synthesis of valuable chemicals, such as ammonia (NH3), has been demonstrated by applying an alternate gas-switching NOx storage-reduction (NSR) process. Herein, we provide significant knowledge to design nanocomposite catalysts that work very well for the selective synthesis of NH3, even at low temperature. To ensure an abundant supply of hydrogen species during the steady-state reaction, we improved the aerosol-assisted synthesis of high-surface-area mesoporous titania (mTiO2) in the presence of an amphiphilic triblock copolymer for the creation of a BaO/Pt@mTiO2 type nanocomposite catalyst. After the storage of NOx as Ba(NO3)2 at temperatures in the range 175 °C-300 °C, solid-state nitrate (NO3−) species could be reduced by switching the inlet gas to hydrogen (H2) at each temperature tested. Based on our previous report where we used BaO/Pt@mAl2O3, a rapid hydrogenation of the NO3− species near Pt nanoparticles leads to the formation of nitrogen (N2) but an abundant supply of hydrogen species, that are spilled over and pooled at the TiO2 surface after the dissociation of H2 over Pt, is very advantageous for the conversion to NH3. Via the rational design of slow hydrogenation at 175 °C with sufficient supply of dissociated hydrogen, the resulting NH3 selectivity exceeded 90% when using BaO/Pt@mTiO2 © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Solid-state hydrogen storage device using metal hydride have enormous advantages for fuel cell forklifts. In addition to high volume hydrogen storage density, the solid-state hydrogen storage device can also be used as a counterweight for the forklift. At the same time, the solid-state storage device has low hydrogen storage pressure and safety, and the fuel (H2) refueling is convenient and low-cost.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen storage plays a pivotal role in the hydrogen industry, yet its current status presents a bottleneck. Diverse strategies have emerged in recent years to address this challenge. MgH2 has stood out as a promising solid-state hydrogen storage material due to its impressive gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen density, but its practical application is hampered by elevated thermal stability and sluggish kinetics. In this study, we introduce a solution by synthesizing Pd metallene through a one-pot solvothermal method, revealing a distinctive highly curved lamellar structure with a thickness of around 1.6 nm. Incorporating this Pd metallene into MgH2 results in a composite system wherein the starting dehydrogenation temperature is significantly lowered to 439 K and complete dehydrogenation occurs at 583 K, releasing 6.14 wt.% hydrogen. The activation energy of dehydrogenation for MgH2 was reduced from 170.4 kJ mol–1 to 79.85 kJ mol–1 after Pd metallene decoration. The enthalpy of dehydrogenation of the MgH2–10 wt.% Pd sample was calculated to be 73 kJ mol–1 H2 –1 and decreased by 4.4 kJ mol–1 H2 –1 from that of dehydrogenation of pure MgH2 (77.4 kJ mol–1 H2 –1). Theoretical calculations show that the average formation energy and average adsorption energy of hydrogen vacancies can be significantly reduced in the presence of both Pd clusters and Pd single atoms on the surface of MgH2/Mg, respectively. It suggests that the synergistic effect of in situ formed Pd single atoms and clusters significantly improves the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation kinetics.

 Abstract:  The Cu9Al4 intermetallic has been found to enhance the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation capabilities of Mg. However, its impact on kinetics is unclear. In the present work, the hydrogenated and dehydrogenated mechanism were investigated by experimental and theoretical methods, including Density Functional Theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations. Experimental results show that the addition of Cu9Al4 IMC can promote the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation kinetics of Mg, which the dehydrogenation rate of Cu9Al4 @MgH2 is 3 times that of MgH2. AIMD simulations illustrate that the electron properties of Cu9Al4 @Mg and Cu9Al4 @MgH2 are different from that of pure Mg and MgH2, which lead to the change of hydrogenated and dehydrogenated mechanism in Mg/Cu9Al4 @Mg and MgH2/Cu9Al4 @MgH2. Moreover, the diffusion coefficient of H atoms in Cu9Al4 @MgH2 is 4 times that in MgH2.

 Abstract:  Solid oxide cell technologies play a pivotal role in the realm of renewable energy storage, guiding us through the journey toward decarbonization. Understanding how electrocatalytic materials behave under high-temperature conditions is an absolute necessity to push these technologies forward. Operando spectroscopic investigations, such as near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP–XPS), offer insights into the chemical nature of active working electrodes, including the dynamic response of redox states and adsorbate chemistry to changing electrochemical conditions. Mixed ceramic–metallic electrodes exhibit a limited region with electrochemically active triple-phase-boundary (TPB) sites, which are located close to the electrolyte/electrode interface. To monitor this specific region spectroscopically, metallic (Ni) and bimetallic (NiCu) network-like structures are synthesized on a yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte and the electrochemical state and performance are studied by using operando NAP–XPS. In the experiments, the surface oxidation states under different polarizations are revealed, the gas composition dependent Nernst shift is confirmed, electrocatalytic activities are unraveled, and hydrogen evolution is correlated with the applied potential.

 Abstract:  Laves phase high-entropy alloys are considered as good candidates for hydrogen storage applications. However, they usually suffer from poor first hydrogenation kinetics, the so-called activation process. In this paper, we attempt to solve the activation problem of the Ti0.5Zr0.5(Mn1-xFex)Cr1 (x = 0, 0.2 and 0.4) by high-pressure torsion (HPT). The HPT process was carried out under 6 GPa pressure for 5 revolutions in air on samples synthesized by arc melting. The hydrogenation kinetics were measured using a Sievert's type apparatus at room temperature under 2 MPa of hydrogen pressure. While the as-cast alloys become totally inert to hydrogen after air exposure, the HPT-processed samples absorb 1.6–1.8 wt% of hydrogen at room temperature in a few seconds even after air exposure for 2 months. The easy activation of alloys processed by HPT is due to the formation of lattice defects that act as nucleation points. These results confirm that HPT processing is an effective strategy to develop active hydrogen storage materials. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

After confirmation of their microstructure, physicochemical features, and morphologies, the fabricated pyrochlores were applied for electrochemical hydrogen storage, and their capacity was compared in an alkaline medium. The La2Zr2O7 microstructure exhibited an enhanced electrochemical hydrogen storage performance (maximum discharge capacity = 2350 mAh/g) compared to the Nd2Zr2O7 structures. Having a higher specific surface, as well as a more favorable physical and chemical nature, could be responsible for this more suitable performance. Lanthanum zirconate ceramic microstructure could be introduced as an active material with an appropriate capacity for electrochemical hydrogen storage. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen holds the advantages of high energy density, great natural abundance and zero emission, making it suitable for large scale and long term energy storage, while its safe and efficient storage is still challenging. Among various solid state hydrogen storage materials, MgH2 is promising for industrial applications due to its high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen densities and the abundance of Mg on earth. However, the practical application of MgH2 has been limited by its stable thermodynamics and slow hydrogen desorption kinetics. Nanocatalysis is considered as a promising approach for improving the hydrogen storage performance of MgH2 and bringing it closer to the requirements of commercial applications. It is worth mentioning that the recently emerging two-dimensional material, MXene, has showcased exceptional catalytic abilities in modifying the hydrogen storage properties of MgH2. Besides, MXene possesses a high surface area, excellent chemical/physical stability, and negatively charged terminating groups, making it an ideal support for the “nanoconfinement” of MgH2 or highly active catalysts. Herein, we endeavor to provide a comprehensive overview of recent investigations on MXene-based catalysts and MXene supports for improving the hydrogen sorption properties of Mg/MgH2. The mechanisms of hydrogen sorption involved in Mg-MXene based composites are highlighted with special emphases on thermodynamics, kinetics, and catalytic behaviors.

 Abstract:  The rechargeable zinc-ion battery is regarded as a promising candidate for the next-generation energy storage system, however, zinc dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have greatly hindered the practical application of the battery. Herein, a functionalized, nano-engineering Zn2+ coordinated carboxylate cellulose solid-state electrolyte (denoted as Zn-CCNF@XG) for zinc-ion battery is constructed through a straightforward approach. According to the experimental and density functional theory (DFT) results of dissociation energy, the notably decreased dissociation energy by −COOH is favorable to Zn2+ de-coordinating and rapid ion-hopping in Zn-CCNF@XG to achieve high ionic conductivity and transference number. More importantly, the engineered molecular channels are beneficial to enlarging the distance between the nanofibril chains, providing a larger space for the movement of Zn2+. Benefiting from the coordination of Zn2+ with −OH in carboxylate cellulose nanofibrils, Zn-CCNF@XG as a good ionic conductor displays a high ionic conductivity of 1.17 × 10−4 S cm−1 and transference number of 0.78. The Zn||NaV3O8·1.5H2O full cell with Zn-CCNF@XG maintains a capacity retention of 83.46% with a coulombic efficiency of 99.99% after 3000 cycles (1 A g−1).

 Abstract:  Conspectus The widespread deployment of solar and wind energy requires advanced energy storage technologies to address the intermittent energy output and the loading limit of the current power grid. Materials are of critical importance for energy storage and conversion. Under such circumstances, development of the advanced energy storage materials featuring high capacity, large energy density, and good safety has been taking center stage in the research areas of physics, chemistry, and materials science. As a class of multifunctional materials, metal hydrides with great potential for energy-related applications such as rechargeable batteries, hydrogen energy storage, thermal storage, and ion conduction are one of the core focuses in the current development of advanced energy materials. In this Account, we summarize our research efforts in the manipulation of thermodynamics and kinetics for advanced hydrogen/lithium storage and ionic conduction applications. By optimization of the compositions, two series of hydrogen storage alloys including La-Mg-Ni-Co-Mn-Al and Ti-Zr-V-Mn-Cr-Ni were developed as the anodes of nickel-metal hydride (Ni/MH) batteries. Among these, La0.7Mg0.3Ni2.45Mn0.1Co0.75Al0.2 and Ti0.8Zr0.2(V0.533Mn0.107Cr0.16Ni0.2)4 alloys delivered ∼370 and 412 mAh g-1 maximum discharge capacities, respectively, >20% higher than those of the commercial AB5-type alloys. Through adding catalysts and fabricating nanostructures, the operation temperatures for hydrogen storage in light-metal hydrides (e.g., MgH2, NaAlH4, Mg(AlH4)2, LiBH4, and Li-Mg-N-H) were largely reduced, and the reversibility was remarkably improved. Support-free MgH2 nanoparticles (4-5 nm) started releasing hydrogen at 30 °C with 6.7 wt % of reversible capacity. This is the first experimental observation of room-temperature hydrogen desorption for light-metal hydrides. Using alkali metals or alkaline earth metals to replace their metal counterparts, a series of metal silicides and sulfides were successfully synthesized at largely lower temperatures and studied for their lithium storage behaviors. This methodology provides a truly original approach for chemical prelithiation of the Si anode. By creating complexes or compositing with solid-state electrolytes, the conductivity of Li+ ions by the LiBH4-based electrolyte was efficiently increased to ∼10-3 S cm-1 at 30 °C with exceptional stability, comparable with the commercial organic liquid electrolyte, displaying remarkable practical application potential. For each application of metal hydrides, we start with the basic working mechanism and highlight the relationship between composition, structure, and properties. At the end of the Account, challenges and future development are proposed and discussed. We hope that this Account could help us to understand the current status and offer insight into future energy storage-related applications of metal hydrides. © 2024 Accounts of Materials Research.

 Abstract:  A key challenge in flexible supercapacitor is balancing the trade-off between high capacity and fast charging ability caused by dense structure-induced sluggish ionic diffusion and storage dynamics. Herein, a hydrogen-rich graphdiyne (GDY)–Ti3C2Tx electrode is reported with tunable interlayer spacing, abundant active sites, and extensive charge storage nanochannels. In particular, the GDY–Ti3C2Tx (12.6 wt.%) electrode has a remarkable volumetric capacitance (2296 F cm−3 at 1 A cm−3) and fast charging behavior (1262 F cm−3 at 50 A cm−3) resulting from the shortened transport pathways, enhanced ionic diffusion rate, and facilitated electrolyte mass transport. Moreover, an all-solid-state supercapacitor (ASSC) delivers a high volumetric energy density of 65.6 mWh cm−3, as well as long-term deformable cyclic stability and high capacitance retention properties under harsh conditions. Density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamic simulation demonstrate the fast electronic responsiveness of the GDY–Ti3C2Tx heterostructure owning to the stronger H+ electrostatic attraction, lower migration resistance, and accelerated intercalation pseudocapacitance kinetics. In situ X-ray diffraction reveals that a stable Ti─O─C bond bridged organic–inorganic heterostructure can tolerate the repeated high-current charge/discharge cycling process. The state-of-the-art ASSC delivers multiple functional outputs and shows great potential for efficient energy supply in practical applications. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

 Abstract:  Catalyst-modified magnesium hydride (MgH2) holds the greatest promise as a solid-state hydrogen storage medium for mobile and stationary applications. However, the design and fabrication of highly active catalysts that enable MgH2 to reversibly desorb/absorb a large amount of hydrogen still remains challenging. In this work, a novel nanostructured ZrFe2 (nano-ZrFe2) measuring 30-120 nm in size was designed and fabricated as a catalyst precursor, which was readily converted into ultrafine ZrH2 and metallic Fe nanoparticles upon ball milling with MgH2 and first de-/hydrogenation, consequently delivering quite high catalytic activity for hydrogen storage in MgH2. MgH2 containing 10 wt% nano-ZrFe2 desorbed 6.2 wt% of H2 starting from approximately 193 °C, which was lowered by 35 °C with respect to the micron-ZrFe2-modified MgH2 (∼228 °C). When operated at a hydrogen pressure of 50 bars, the dehydrogenated sample absorbed ∼5.3 wt% of H2 at 200 °C within 30 minutes. The remarkably improved kinetic properties of MgH2 are mainly attributed to the ultrasmall nanoparticles and uniform, dispersive distribution of in situ formed ZrH2 and Fe. Such in situ conversion of nano-ZrFe2 not only provided a multiphase and multiscale catalytic environment that enabled high reactivity and catalytic activity but also facilitated H diffusion owing to increased interfaces, consequently promoting the dissociation and recombination of H2 molecules.

 Abstract:  Magnesium hydride (MgH2) has been expected as a promising solid material for efficiently storing hydrogen, but its practical applications have been impeded by stable thermodynamics and slow hydrogen desorption kinetics. In this study, we synthesized Ti3+ self-doped 3D TiO2 hollow nano-boxes (Ti3+@TiO2) through a facile hydrothermal reaction and investigated their influence on the hydrogen storage properties of MgH2. The abundant oxygen vacancies of Ti3+@TiO2 and the in-situ formed multivalent state of Ti-containing species during the de/re-hydrogenation process resulted in an excellent catalytic effect on the hydrogen storage properties of MgH2. The BM-MgH2-Ti3+@TiO2-5 composite exhibited a low initial hydrogen desorption temperature of 205.4 °C, 49.2% reduction compared to pristine MgH2. The BM-MgH2-Ti3+@TiO2-5 composite could release 6.1 wt% of hydrogen at 325 °C within 20 min, and the activation energy (Ea) of dehydrogenation was decreased significantly to 57.2 ± 1.4 kJ/mol, achieving superior hydrogen desorption kinetics. In addition, this composite also demonstrated remarkable cycling stability, with hydrogen capacity retention of 93.7% after 10 consecutive de-/rehydrogenated cycles at 325 °C.

 Abstract:  MgH2 is a promising solid–state hydrogen storage material. However, its high thermodynamics and sluggish kinetics hinder its practical application. Catalytic strategy is effective in improving its kinetic performance. Nevertheless, the highly efficient catalysts or additives are normally of low-yield in fabrication with high cost. In this work, a novel structural LaVO4 fabricated by a low-cost method of spraying dry followed by a calcination is used as a catalytic additive for the hydrogen storage of MgH2. With an optimized addition of LaVO4, the overall hydrogen storage performances of MgH2 are significantly improved. An onset dehydrogenation temperature of only 183°C is obtained after an initial activation of dehydrogenation and hydrogenation. The system can desorb 5.7 wt% H2 at 250°C within 10 min and maintains a dehydrogenation capacity of 5.0 wt% H2 after 50 cycles. It is found that LaVO4 is transferred to lanthanum hydride and metallic vanadium in the initial dehydrogenation process, the former acts as a highly effective catalyst for the hydrogen storage of MgH2 and the latter undergoes reversible hydrogenation and dehydrogenation in the subsequent cycles. The structural design of the catalyst and its scalable fabrication are highly valuable in realizing the practical application of catalytic strategy for the hydrogen storage of MgH2. © 2024

 Abstract:  Although MgH2 has been widely regarded as a promising material for solid-state hydrogen storage, its high operating temperature and slow kinetics pose a major bottleneck to its practical application. Here, a nanocomposite catalyst with interfacial coupling and oxygen defects, Ni/CeO2, is fabricated to promote H2 desorption and absorption properties of MgH2. The interface of Ni/CeO2 contributes to both strong mechanical coupling towards stabilizing partial Ni and electronic coupling towards inducing a high concentration of oxygen vacancies in CeO2. Theoretical calculations evidence that CeO2 with oxygen vacancy assist Ni in weakening the energy of Mg-H bond as well as enhancing the adsorption energy of Ni upon hydrogen atoms, and the extent of this assistance surprisingly increases with increasing oxygen vacancies concentration. As a result, an impressive performance is achieved by MgH2-5 wt.% Ni/CeO2 with onset desorption temperature of only 165 °C, and it absorbs approximately 80% hydrogen in just 800 s at 125 °C. The generation mechanism of intermediate active species concerning Ni/CeO2 in different states has been analyzed for the first time, and the relationship between interfacial coupling and phase evolution has been elucidated. Therefore, a mechanism of the catalysis-assisting effect regarding oxygen defects is proposed. It is believed that this work provides a unique perspective on the mechanism of interfacial coupling and the generation of defects in composite catalysts. © 2023

 Abstract:  MgH2 is a promising high-capacity solid-state hydrogen storage material, while its application is greatly hindered by the high desorption temperature and sluggish kinetics. Herein, intertwined 2D oxygen vacancy-rich V2O5 nanosheets (H-V2O5) are specifically designed and used as catalysts to improve the hydrogen storage properties of MgH2. The as-prepared MgH2-H-V2O5 composites exhibit low desorption temperatures (Tonset = 185 °C) with a hydrogen capacity of 6.54 wt%, fast kinetics (Ea = 84.55 ± 1.37 kJ mol−1 H2 for desorption), and long cycling stability. Impressively, hydrogen absorption can be achieved at a temperature as low as 30 °C with a capacity of 2.38 wt% within 60 min. Moreover, the composites maintain a capacity retention rate of ~ 99% after 100 cycles at 275 °C. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the in-situ formed VH2/V catalysts, unique 2D structure of H-V2O5 nanosheets, and abundant oxygen vacancies positively contribute to the improved hydrogen sorption properties. Notably, the existence of oxygen vacancies plays a double role, which could not only directly accelerate the hydrogen ab/de-sorption rate of MgH2, but also indirectly affect the activity of the catalytic phase VH2/V, thereby further boosting the hydrogen storage performance of MgH2. This work highlights an oxygen vacancy excited “hydrogen pump” effect of VH2/V on the hydrogen sorption of Mg/MgH2.

 Abstract:  The gastric acidity scale has been imaged by integration of the pH-conversion model (pH-CM) into 3D-gastro electrical impedance tomography (3D-g-EIT) under the influence of spatial mean hydrogen-specific conductivity σH. The pH-CM uses Debye-Hückel-Onsager (DHO) interionic equation, molar conductivity ratio, ωH, viscosity ηstate(k) and relative permittivity εstate(k) in order to convert the imaged conductivity distribution σ to the pH distribution pH*. With the proposed integration, phantoms of empty (S1), liquid storage (S2-S4), and solid meal storage (S5) states are measured to reflect the dilution state. In the case of empty (S1), the artificial gastric juice is made based on 99.50% of H2O and 0.50% solution consisting of HCl (1.4263 g/L), KCl (0.8647 g/L), and NaCl (2.8559 g/L). In the case of the liquid storage (S2-S4) state, 200 mL of H2O is added three times as a dilution of artificial gastric juice in each S2, S3, and S4. In the solid meal storage (S5) state, an acid solid meal is blended into the artificial gastric content. The modified constants, α, and β are calculated based on the variation of viscosity ηstate(k) and permittivity εstate(k) of each state. The conductivity of gastric-shape models in five states is studied in the simulation. In the experiments, the simulated models were measured as gastric phantoms. Integrating pH-CM into 3D-g-EIT successfully images the pH* in the simulations and experiments. As a result, the estimated acidity scale 〈pH〉 is inversely proportional to σH with mean pH error evaluation of simulations eˆpH(sim) and experiments eˆpH(sim) are 15.8% and 8.5%, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Hydrogel electrolyte is widely used in solid energy storage devices because of its high ionic conductivity, environmental friendliness, and non-leakage property. However, hydrogel electrolyte is not resistant to freezing. Here, a high proton conductive zwitterionic hydrogel electrolyte with super conductivity of 1.51 mS cm–1 at −50 °C is fabricated by random copolymerization of acrylamide and zwitterionic monomer in the presence of 1 m H2SO4 and ethylene glycol (EG). The antifreezing performance and low temperature conductivity are ascribed to hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds between the components and water molecules in the system and can be tuned by changing the monomer ratio and EG contents. The proton hopping migration on the ionic group of the polymer chains and Grotthuss proton transport mechanism are responsible for the high proton conductivity while Grotthuss transport is dominated at the glassy state of the polymer chains. The electrolyte-assembled supercapacitor (SC) offers high specific capacitance of 93.5 F g–1 at 25 °C and 62.0 F g–1 at −50 °C with a capacitance retention of 91.1% and 81.5% after 10 000 cycles, respectively.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen is an efficient energy carrier that can be produced from renewable sources, enabling the transition towards CO2-free energy. Hydrogen can be stored for a long period in the solid-state, with suitable alloys. Ti-rich TiFe0.90 compound exhibits a mild activation process for the first hydrogenation, and Ti(Fe,Mn)0.90 substituted alloys can lead to the fine tuning of equilibrium pressure as a function of the final application. In this study, the crystal structure of TiFe(0.90-x)Mnx alloys (x = 0, 0.05 and 0.10) and their deuterides has been determined by in-situ neutron diffraction, while recording Pressure-Composition Isotherms at room temperature. The investigation aims at analysing the influence of Mn for Fe substitution in Ti-rich Ti(Fe,Mn)0.90 alloys on structural properties during reversible deuterium loading, which is still unsolved and seldom explored. After activation, samples have been transferred into custom-made stainless-steel and aluminium alloy cells used for in-situ neutron diffraction experiments during deuterium loading at ILL and ISIS neutron facilities, respectively. The study enables remarkable understanding on hydrogen storage, basic structural knowledge, and support to the industrial application of TiFe-type alloys for integrated hydrogen tank in energy storage systems by determining the volume expansion during deuteration. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that different contents of Mn do not significantly change the volumetric expansion during phase transitions, affecting only the deuterium content for the γ phase and the cell evolution for the β phase. The study confirms that the deuterated structures of the γ phase upon absorption, β and α phase upon desorption, correspond to S.G. Cmmm, P2221 and Pm-3m, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Despite the promise of TiFe-based alloys as low-cost solid-state hydrogen storage materials with mild operating conditions and reasonable hydrogen capacity, their initial hydrogenation process is difficult, hindering broad utilization. The effect of alloying element on the initial hydrogenation kinetics of TiFe alloys, TiFe0.9M0.1 (M = V, Cr, Fe, Co and Ni), was evaluated by analyzing changes to the passivating surface oxide layer that inhibits hydrogen permeation, as well as the ease of initial-stage hydrogen absorption into the underlying matrix. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atom probe tomography revealed key variations in surface oxide compositions and thinning of the passivating oxide layer compared to pure TiFe, which suggests suppressed oxide growth by alloying-induced elemental redistribution. At the same time, density functional theory calculations predicted exothermic formation of hydride nuclei when alloying with V or Cr, as well as a reduced nucleation barrier when alloying with Co or Ni. Overall, these results are consistent with the observed experimental trend of the activation kinetics. We propose that improvements in activation kinetics of TiFe with alloying arises from the combined effect of reduced passivating oxide thickness and easier hydride nucleation, offering a starting point for alloy design strategies towards further improvement. © 2022 The Author(s)

 Abstract:  Globally, reducing CO2 emissions is an urgent priority. The hydrogen economy is a system that offers long-term solutions for a secure energy future and the CO2 crisis. From hydrogen production to consumption, storing systems are the foundation of a viable hydrogen economy. Each step has been the topic of intense research for decades; however, the development of a viable, safe, and efficient strategy for the storage of hydrogen remains the most challenging one. Storing hydrogen in polymer-based carriers can realize a more compact and much safer approach that does not require high pressure and cryogenic temperature, with the potential to reach the targets determined by the United States Department of Energy. This review highlights an outline of the major polymeric material groups that are capable of storing and releasing hydrogen reversibly. According to the hydrogen storage results, there is no optimal hydrogen storage system for all stationary and automotive applications so far. Additionally, a comparison is made between different polymeric carriers and relevant solid-state hydrogen carriers to better understand the amount of hydrogen that can be stored and released realistically. © 2022 by the authors.

 Abstract:  Through the Mg/MgH2 system case study, this chapter presents the primary interest of thermal analysis and calorimetry to study the hydrogen storage properties of solid-state materials in detail. The dehydrogenation temperature and the hydrogen storage capacity can be obtained by performing temperature programmed desorption and thermogravimetric analysis experiments. These two techniques allow fast experiments with only a few milligrams of sample and are generally used in the literature to study the potential of a new additive, the influence of the preparation method, and to test the performances of new storage systems. For a deeper characterization of the dehydrogenation properties, specifically the kinetics (apparent activation energy) and the thermodynamics (enthalpy), DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) technique can be used. The Sieverts (volumetric) technique is a powerful tool to investigate the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation properties (kinetics and thermodynamics) and the reversibility of the storage system under isothermal conditions. Finally, the high-pressure DSC technique is of particular interest as it allows to couple calorimetric experiments with a volumetric analysis and study all the important hydrogen storage properties, including storage capacity, hydrogenation and dehydrogenation temperatures, apparent activation energies, and enthalpies, by using only one technique. In this chapter, the strengths and weaknesses of the different instruments are highlighted as well as the working principles and the measured storage properties. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

 Abstract:  Featuring a high hydrogen storage content of up to 20 wt%, complex metal borohydrides remain promising solid state hydrogen storage materials, with the real prospect of reversible behavior for a zero–emission economy. However, the thermodynamic barriers and sluggish kinetics are still barriers to overcome. In this context, nanoconfinement has provided a reliable method to improve the behavior of hydrogen storage materials. The present work describes the thermodynamic and kinetic enhancements of LiBH4 nanoconfined in MFe2O4 (M=Co, Ni) ferrite-catalyzed graphene host. Composites of LiBH4-catalysts were prepared by melt infiltration and investigated by X-ray diffraction, TEM, STEM-EDS and TPD. The role of ferrite additives, metal precursor treatment (Ar, Ar/H2) and the effect on hydrogen storage parameters are discussed. The thermodynamic parameters for the most promising composite LiBH4-graphene-NiFe2O4 (Ar) were investigated by Kissinger plot method, revealing an EA = 127 kJ/mol, significantly lower than that of neat LiBH4 (170 kJ/mol). The reversible H2 content of LiBH4-graphene-NiFe2O4 (Ar) after 5 a/d cycles was ~6.14 wt%, in line with DOE’s target of 5.5 wt% storage capacity, while exhibiting the lowest desorption temperature peak of 349 °C. The composites with catalysts treated in Ar have lower desorption temperature due to better catalyst dispersion than using H2/Ar. © 2023 by the authors.

 Abstract:  Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a potential solution for a low-carbon society and clean energy storage due to its ability to produce hydrogen and oxygen. However, the slow oxidation half-reaction of the process has limited its overall efficacy, necessitating the development of an efficient photoanode. Colloidal CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs) have been identified as promising candidates due to their high light absorption and valence band position. However, the presence of the electrical insulator, long-chain oleate molecules, on the surface of the CsPbBr3 NCs has hindered efficient charge carrier separation and transport. To solve this problem, short-chain 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) ligands were used to replace the oleate ligands on the surface of the CsPbBr3 NCs through a solid-state ligand exchange method. This resulted in a reduction of the nanocrystal spacing and a cross-linking reaction, which improved the photogenerated carrier separation and transport while still passivating the dangling bonds on the CsPbBr3 NC surface. Ultimately, this led to a remarkable photocurrent density of 3.34 mA cm-2 (1.23 VRHE), which was 5.2 times higher than that of the pristine oleate-CsPbBr3 NC (0.64 mA cm-2)-based device.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen storage is a key link in hydrogen economy, where solid-state hydrogen storage is considered as the most promising approach because it can meet the requirement of high density and safety. Thereinto, magnesium-based materials (MgH2) are currently deemed as an attractive candidate due to the potentially high hydrogen storage density (7.6 wt%), however, the stable thermodynamics and slow kinetics limit the practical application. In this study, we design a ternary transition metal sulfide FeNi2S4 with a hollow balloon structure as a catalyst of MgH2 to address the above issues by constructing a MgH2/Mg2NiH4-MgS/Fe system. Notably, the dehydrogenation/hydrogenation of MgH2 has been significantly improved due to the synergistic catalysis of active species of Mg2Ni/Mg2NiH4, MgS and Fe originated from the MgH2-FeNi2S4 composite. The hydrogen absorption capacity of the MgH2-FeNi2S4 composite reaches to 4.02 wt% at 373 K for 1 h, a sharp contrast to the milled-MgH2 (0.67 wt%). In terms of dehydrogenation process, the initial dehydrogenation temperature of the composite is 80 K lower than that of the milled-MgH2, and the dehydrogenation activation energy decreases by 95.7 kJ·mol–1 compared with the milled-MgH2 (161.2 kJ·mol–1). This method provides a new strategy for improving the dehydrogenation/hydrogenation performance of the MgH2 material. © 2022

 Abstract:  Given its significant gravimetric hydrogen capacity advantage, lithium alanate (LiAlH4) is regarded as a suitable material for solid-state hydrogen storage. Nevertheless, its outrageous decomposition temperature and slow sorption kinetics hinder its application as a solid-state hydrogen storage material. This research’s objective is to investigate how the addition of titanium silicate (TiSiO4) altered the dehydrogenation behavior of LiAlH4. The LiAlH4–10 wt% TiSiO4 composite dehydrogenation temperatures were lowered to 92 °C (first-step reaction) and 128 °C (second-step reaction). According to dehydrogenation kinetic analysis, the TiSiO4-added LiAlH4 composite was able to liberate more hydrogen (about 6.0 wt%) than the undoped LiAlH4 composite (less than 1.0 wt%) at 90 °C for 2 h. After the addition of TiSiO4, the activation energies for hydrogen to liberate from LiAlH4 were lowered. Based on the Kissinger equation, the activation energies for hydrogen liberation for the two-step dehydrogenation of post-milled LiAlH4 were 103 and 115 kJ/mol, respectively. After milling LiAlH4 with 10 wt% TiSiO4, the activation energies were reduced to 68 and 77 kJ/mol, respectively. Additionally, the scanning electron microscopy images demonstrated that the LiAlH4 particles shrank and barely aggregated when 10 wt% of TiSiO4 was added. According to the X-ray diffraction results, TiSiO4 had a significant effect by lowering the decomposition temperature and increasing the rate of dehydrogenation of LiAlH4 via the new active species of AlTi and Si-containing that formed during the heating process. © 2023 by the authors.

 Abstract:  Ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) hydrolysis is an effective strategy for utilizing sustainable hydrogen energy. However, a suitable catalyst is indispensable because this reaction cannot occur kinetically at ambient temperature. In this work, N, O co-doped hierarchical porous carbon materials are facilely prepared from glucose by using K2CO3 as the activation agent, followed by employing to confine Ru nanoclusters (NCs) for AB hydrolysis. The proper porous structure of PC-5–700 (SBET = 1356 m2 g−1, Vtotal = 0.762 cm3 g−1, Vmicro/Vtotal = 56.0%), which is prepared with a mass ratio of 5: 1 for K2CO3 to glucose and calcined at 700 ℃, are beneficial to the high dispersion of Ru NCs. Additionally, the doped heteroatoms increase the hydrophilicity of the materials, enhancing the active site accessibility in polar solvents. Also, the lone pair electrons of N and O can form chelation with Ru3+ ions, facilitating Ru dispersion and enhancing the surface electronic density. As a result, PC-5–700 confined Ru NCs with a mean size of 1.3 nm display excellent catalytic performance in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB.

 Abstract:  Solid-state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) are highly desirable for energy storage because of the urgent need for higher energy density and safer batteries. However, it remains a critical challenge for stable cycling of SSLMBs at low temperature. Here, a highly viscoelastic polyether-b-amide (PEO-b-PA) based composite solid-state electrolyte is proposed through a one-pot melt processing without solvent to address this key process. By adjusting the molar ratio of PEO-b-PA to lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (ethylene oxide:Li = 6:1) and adding 20 wt.% succinonitrile, fast Li+ transport channel is conducted within the homogeneous polymer electrolyte, which enables its application at ultra-low temperature (−20 to 25 °C).

 Abstract:  The increasing demand for wearable electronics calls for advanced energy storage solutions that integrate high electrochemical performances and mechanical robustness. Ionogel is a promising candidate due to its stretchability combined with high ionic conductivity. However, simultaneously optimizing both the electrochemical and mechanical performance of ionogels remains a challenge. This paper reports a tough and highly ion-conductive ionogel through ion impregnation and solvent exchange. The fabricated ionogel consists of double interpenetrating networks of long polymer chains that provide high stretchability. The polymer chains are crosslinked by hydrogen bonds that induce large energy dissipation for enhanced toughness. The resultant ionogel possesses mechanical stretchability of 26, tensile strength of 1.34 MPa, and fracture toughness of 4175 J m−2.

 Abstract:  The efficient operation of a metal hydride reactor depends on the hydrogen sorption and desorption reaction rate. In this regard, special attention is paid to heat management solutions when designing metal hydride hydrogen storage systems. One of the effective solutions for improving the heat and mass transfer effect in metal hydride beds is the use of heat exchangers.

 Abstract:  Modified SAT-urea eutectic salts (EPCM) as the phase-change materials were prepared using modifiers such as disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate (DHPD) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). The support material, hydrophilic modified activated carbon (MAC), was prepared using OP-10 as a hydrophilic modifier. The vacuum impregnation method was used to fabricate the MAC-based shape-stabilized eutectic phase-change materials (SSEPCM). The gypsum-based building materials with thermal storage capacity were obtained by compositing surface-treated SSEPCM and gypsum. The surface contact angle, surface functional group, phase transition temperature, latent heat, phase composition, and microstructure of the SSEPCM were examined using the static contact angle meter, Fourier infrared spectrometer, in-situ infrared spectrometer, differential scanning calorimeter, X-ray diffractometer, and scanning electron microscope. The adsorption capacity of MAC increased first and then decreased with the increase of OP-10 content in the modified solution. When the OP-10 content was 0.3 wt%, the contact angle between the surface of MAC and water reduced to 0°, and the mass fraction of EPCM relative to MAC was 93.1 wt%. The results showed that the OP-10 had a good hydrophilic modification effect on the granular activated carbon. The X-ray diffractometer and differential scanning calorimeter results of SSEPCM indicated that there was no chemical reaction between EPCM and MAC, the phase transition temperature was 32.11 °C, and the latent heat was 103 J/g. The latent heat loss rate of SSEPCM was 5.8 % after 100 thermal cycles, and the number of –OH did not decrease during the heating process of SSEPCM, which showed that SSEPCM had good thermal stability. The flexural and compressive strength values of the SSEPCM/gypsum composites were 2.50 MPa and 7.36 MPa, respectively, when 45 wt% SSEPCM was incorporated into the gypsum matrix, which was sufficient for practical applications. The introduction of SSEPCM could slowly reduce the thermal conductivity and significantly improved the thermal inertia of the composites. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

 Abstract:  The growing demand for energy and the need to reduce the carbon footprint has made green hydrogen a promising alternative to traditional fossil fuels. Green hydrogen is produced using renewable energy sources, making it a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy source. Solid-state hydrogen storage aims to store hydrogen in a solid matrix, offering potential advantages such as higher safety and improved energy density compared to traditional storage methods such as compressed gas or liquid hydrogen.

 Abstract:  Sodium phenoxide is a potentially promising hydrogen storage material due to its high hydrogen capacity and enhanced thermodynamic properties. Nevertheless, efficient catalysts are still lacking due to the high kinetic barrier for the reversible hydrogen uptake and release of sodium phenoxide. In the current work, a comparative study on the catalytic hydrogenation of sodium phenoxide was conducted. To our delight, a simple yet effective ruthenium-based catalyst was identified to respond aggressively to hydrogen in the solid-state hydrogenation of sodium phenoxide even at room temperature. The activity was enhanced by 6 fold with the as-synthesized 5.0% Ru/TiO2 catalyst as compared to that with commercial 5.0% Ru/Al2O3, respectively, under the same conditions. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  The practical applications of MgH2 as a high-density hydrogen carrier depend heavily on efficient and low-cost catalysts to accelerate the dehydriding/hydriding reactions at moderate temperatures. In the present work, this issue is addressed by synthesizing Nb-doped TiO2 solid-solution-type catalysts that dramatically improve the hydrogen sorption performances of MgH2. The catalyzed MgH2 can absorb 5 wt % of H2 even at room temperature for 20 s, release 6 wt % of H2 at 225 °C within 12 min, and the complete dehydrogenation can be achieved at 150 °C under a dynamic vacuum atmosphere. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Nb doping introduces Nb 4d orbitals with stronger interaction with H 1s into the density of states of TiO2. This considerably enhances both the adsorption and dissociation ability of the H2 molecule on the catalysts surface and the hydrogen diffusion across the specific Mg/Ti(Nb)O2 interface. The successful implementation of solid solution-type catalysts in MgH2 offers a demonstration and inspiration for the development of high-performance catalysts and solid-state hydrogen storage materials. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  While low-cost natural gas remains abundant, the energy content of this fuel can be utilized without greenhouse gas emissions through the production of molecular hydrogen and solid carbon via methane pyrolysis. In the absence of a carbon tax, methane pyrolysis is not economically competitive with current hydrogen production methods unless the carbon byproducts can be valorized. In this work, we assess the viability of the carbon byproduct produced from methane pyrolysis in molten salts as high-value-added anode or conductive additive for secondary Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. Raman characterization and electrochemical differential capacity analysis demonstrate that the use of molten salt mixtures with catalytically-active FeCl3-or MnCl2 result in more graphitic carbon co-products. These graphitic carbons exhibit the best electrochemical performance (up to 272 mAh/g of reversible capacity) when used as Li-ion anodes. For all carbon samples studied here, disordered carbon domains and retained salt species trapped and/or intercalated into the carbon structure were identified by X-ray photoelectron and multinuclear solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The latter lead to reduced electrochemical activity and reversibility, and poorer rate performance compared to commercial carbon anodes. The electronic conductivity of the pyrolyzed carbons is found to be highly dependent on their purity, with the purest carbon exhibiting an electronic conductivity nearly on par with that of commercial carbon additives. These findings suggest that more effective removal of the salt catalyst could enable applications of these carbons in secondary batteries, providing a financial incentive for the large-scale implementation of methane pyrolysis for “low-carbon” hydrogen production. © 2022 The Authors

 Abstract:  Solid-state hydrogen storage is regarded as the key technology to develop commercial application of hydrogen energy, and Mg added with high efficiency catalysts is a promising candidate to break through the barrier of hydrogen storage materials. Herein, Mg−Al and Mg−Al−Zr nanocomposites have been prepared by adding the single-metal (Al) and bimetal (Al, Zr) into Mg nanoparticles by the hydrogen plasma-metal reaction (HPMR) method. The two kinds of nanocomposites have an approximate size of 100 nm. With the expansion of the plasma current, the content of Al and Zr in Mg−Al−Zr nanocomposites increases gradually, and the addition of Al and Zr conspicuously accelerates the kinetics of hydrogen absorption and desorption of Mg. Compared with the nanocomposites with the single-metal (Al), the addition of bimetal (Al, Zr) can further enhance the hydrogen absorption kinetics of Mg, and the content of Zr has a positive effect on the reduction of activation energy (Ea). The Ea of Mg88.3Al7.6Zr4.1 for hydrogen absorption is 68.6 kJ/mol, which is significantly lower than that of Mg92.6Al7.4 (80.6 kJ/mol) and other two Mg−Al−Zr nanocomposites with low Al and Zr (70.7 and 69.8 kJ/mol, respectively). Both the nanostructure of Mg and the synergistic catalytic effects of active “catalytic sites” and H “diffusion channels” provided by the multiphase nanocatalysts of MgAl and AlZr3 contribute to the reduction of Ea.

 Abstract:  First principles calculations have been adopted to explore ground-state and high-pressure properties of KCaH3 and KSrH3 orthorhombic perovskite hydrides for the purpose of solid-state hydrogen storage. Formation enthalpies of materials, structural and mechanical properties, electronic and hydrogen storage properties are computed and examined. The computed formation enthalpies and phonon frequencies of KCaH3 and KSrH3 indicate dynamical stability at 0 GPa. The gravimetric hydrogen densities of KCaH3 and KSrH3 are found to be 3.55 wt% and 2.28 wt%, respectively. Also, the hydrogen desorption temperatures are calculated as 449 K and 394 K for KCaH3 and KSrH3. Elastic constants for each phase and several parameters derived from elastic constants are computed and evaluated, such as bulk and Shear modulus. The B/G ratios of materials depict that both KCaH3 and KSrH3 are brittle materials. The electronic properties show band gaps for both materials at 0 GPa, confirming an insulating nature and as pressure increases the band gap shrinks for KCaH3 and disappears for KSrH3.

 Abstract:  MgH2, a solid-state hydrogen storage material with high storage capacity, is facing the obstacles of high thermodynamic stability and slow reaction kinetics. Herein, different Vanadium (V) based catalysts (V2O5, Fe–V and V–Ni oxides) were synthesized by a hydrothermal method and ball milled with MgH2 to modify its hydrogen storage property. It is observed that the dehydrogenation performance (initial dehydrogenation temperature and desorption rate) of Fe–V oxide doped MgH2 was the best, followed by V2O5 and V–Ni oxide modified systems. The MgH2+7 wt% Fe–V composite exhibited an onset dehydrogenation temperature of 200 °C, 128 °C lower compared with the original MgH2. The absorption performance of MgH2 was also greatly enhanced by Fe–V oxide. The 7 wt% Fe–V modified MgH2 after dehydrogenation began to charge hydrogen from 25 °C to 5.1 wt% hydrogen was absorbed at 150 °C. The activation energy for hydrogen uptake of MgH2 was reduced from 76.5 ± 3.4 kJ/mol to 41.2 ± 4.7 kJ/mol. Additionally, the MgH2+7 wt% Fe–V composite maintained 97.2% hydrogen capacity after10 cycles.

 Abstract:  In the burgeoning field of hydrogen energy, compositionally complex alloys promise unprecedented solid-state hydrogen storage applications. However, compositionally complex alloys are facing one main challenge: reducing alloy density and increasing hydrogen storage capacity. Here, we report TiMgLi-based compositionally complex alloys with ultralow alloy density and significant room-temperature hydrogen storage capacity. The record-low alloy density (2.83 g cm−3) is made possible by multi-principal-lightweight element alloying. Introducing multiple phases instead of a single phase facilitates obtaining a large hydrogen storage capacity (2.62 wt% at 50 °C under 100 bar of H2). The kinetic modeling results indicate that three-dimensional diffusion governs the hydrogenation reaction of the current compositionally complex alloys at 50 °C.

 Abstract:  Various techniques enabling surface severe plastic deformation (SSPD) have been developed or optimised over the past years. This manuscript presents a broad overview of recent developments in the field of SSPD and its application that take advantages of having a deformed gradient surface with both (i) higher strength and (ii) an improved ""reactivity"". First, the principle and technological advantages/ disadvantages of several SSPD technologies, involving either guided or non-directional mechanical impacts, are recalled. Then, after a short recall on the nature of the structure the modified surface formed under SSPD, the effects of the processing parameters and temperature of deformation on the surface roughness and subsurface microstructure modifications are illustrated with a particular emphasis on the surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) and ultrasonic shot peening (USP) techniques deriving from the traditional pre-strain shot peening. The effect of these surface and sub-surface modifications on the mechanical properties, and in particular the fatigue response, are recalled with a special emphasis on the surface integrity and potential over shot peening. Then, the manuscript concentrates on the effect of the surface enhanced diffusion of chemical species induced by the presence of structural defects to modify the corrosion behaviour and enhance the potential assisted SSPD + thermo-chemically ""duplex""treatments. In these cases, in addition to induce grain refinement and dislocations, the importance of controlling some potential surface contamination is stressed.

 Abstract:  Achieving superionic conductivity from solid-state polymer electrolytes is an important task in the development of future energy storage and conversion technologies. Herein, a platform for innovative electrolyte technologies based on a bifunctional polymer, poly(3-hydroxy-4-sulfonated styrene) (PS-3H4S), is presented. By incorporating -OH and -SO3H functional groups at adjacent positions in the styrene repeating unit, “intra-monomer” hydrogen bonds are formed to effectively weaken the electrostatic interactions of the -SO3− moieties in the polymer matrix with embedded ions, promoting rich structural and dynamic heterogeneity in the PS-3H4S electrolyte. Upon the incorporation of an ionic liquid, interconnected rod-like ion channels, which allow the decoupling of ion relaxation from polymer relaxation, are formed in the stiff motif of the polymeric domains passivated by interfacial ionic layers. This results in accelerated proton hopping through the glassy polymer matrix, and proton hopping becomes more pronounced at cryogenic temperatures down to −35 °C. The PS-3H4S/ionic liquid composite electrolytes exhibit a high ionic conductivity of 10−3 S cm−1 and high storage modulus of ≈100 MPa at 25 °C, and can be successfully applied in soft actuators and lithium-metal batteries. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

 Abstract:  Silicon nanowires (SiNWs) have attracted great interest for applications in high-performance miniaturized devices and energy-harvesting and -storage systems. Vapor-liquid-solid growth and metal-assisted chemical etching methods are the most commonly used approaches for synthesizing silicon nanowires. However, using these catalyst-assisted methods, producing a large quantity of silicon nanowires with diameters less than 10 nm is elusive, and removal of the catalysts is a challenge for their practical applications. Recently, we reported the synthesis of highly dense and vertically aligned sub-5 nm silicon nanowires with a high aspect ratio of over 10 000 via the catalyst-free chemical vapor etching of silicon. In this paper, we systematically investigated the effect of key chemical vapor etching parameters that govern the morphology of silicon nanowires. We achieved highly aligned nanowire arrays with sub-5 nm diameters and lengths of up to 52.1 μm by controlling the oxidant gas concentration, the reaction temperature, and the hydrogen concentration. These results demonstrate that the ppm level of oxidant gases is crucial for the steady-state etching of silicon into nanowires via passivating their surface with a silicon suboxide layer. Furthermore, thermodynamic analysis combined with the experimental results suggests that the anisotropic etching of silicon is also facilitated by increasing the reaction temperature and hydrogen concentration, due to the increased ratio between the two primary etchants (HCl/SiCl4), suggesting an optimum range of the etchant ratio (i.e., 0.131-0.216) for nanowire formation. Our results can help us to understand the chemical vapor Si etching process and guide the scalable synthesis of ultra-narrow silicon nanowires for future scientific research and practical applications. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Researchers have focused on nanostructure materials in the last decade, which can play an essential role in storing hydrogen gas. Hydrogen is a future source of energy, having handling and storage challenges. In the new generation, solid-state materials have been used to store hydrogen gas as a metal hydride. Based on materials properties, Mg hydride is the most promising material to store hydrogen in a solid-state material. The theoretical hydrogen storage capacity of magnesium hydride is 7.6 wt% making it a more suitable material for hydrogen storage in the future. Instead of having high storage capacity, magnesium's practical application as a hydride is limited due to its low kinetics and high working temperature. Aside from the less thermo-stability of bulk MgH2, to achieve the maximum hydrogen storage capacity the decomposition required a higher temperature of about 300 °C with 1 bar pressure. As a result, it is necessary to optimize the stability of hydrogen and magnesium molecules to enhance kinetic and thermodynamic properties. The critical factors in improving hydrogenation properties are decreasing particle size (nano-scale) and adding various catalysts. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  ConspectusPorous organic framework materials constructed by periodically aligned molecular entities offer chemically tailored microenvironments to absorb molecules and ions for various applications. Fundamentally understanding the microenvironments of these porous organic materials-from pore size, shape, and dynamics to potential substrate binding sites-is critical for the rational design of porous organic materials. The solid-state structures of these porous organic materials, such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), can provide unambiguous atomic-level structural details. However, it remains challenging to synthesize these materials as single crystals that can be fully characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) or rotational electron diffraction (RED) analysis. In addition, the balance of single crystallinity, permanent porosity, and good chemical stability requires delicate control of the assembly of the molecular building blocks and covalent crosslinking during synthesis. In this Account, we discuss the development of hydrogen-bonded crosslinked organic frameworks (HCOFs) possessing balanced single crystallinity and high chemical stability. HCOFs are obtained through covalently crosslinking molecular crystals that are preorganized via hydrogen bonding. Due to the dual hydrogen-bonded network and covalent crosslinking, HCOFs can deform upon guest adsorption by breaking the hydrogen bonds and subsequently restore their original form through the desorption of guests by re-establishing the hydrogen-bonded networks. Thus, HCOFs can dynamically adjust their pore sizes according to the framework-substrate interactions. In the discussion, we link HCOFs with COFs and single-crystalline 2D polymers by comparing their synthetic approaches to accessing high crystallinity. The method to synthesize HCOFs allows for the employment of various flexible building blocks and linking motifs that are largely avoided in the current design regimes of COFs and 2D polymers. We also draw the connections between HCOFs and hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) by highlighting their shared design principles for constructing hydrogen-bonding networks with large voids. Compared to their hydrogen-bonded precursor crystals, reinforcing the hydrogen-bonded networks with covalent linkages endows HCOFs with enhanced chemical and structural stability. In addition, we emphasize that the structure elucidation of HCOFs often requires combined SCXRD analysis and experimental evidence, with the methods and challenges thoroughly discussed. The details are presented in the following sequence: (1) synthesizing single-crystalline COFs by matching the polycondensation rate to the nucleation rate and their subsequent analyses by SCXRD/RED; (2) obtaining single-crystalline polymers and networks through topochemical reactions; (3) constructing HOFs with designed voids using highly directional hydrogen bonding building blocks; and (4) developing HCOFs via monomer crystal engineering followed by single-crystal to single-crystal (SCSC) synthesis and studying their unique dynamic guest sorption behaviors. We hope this Account will inspire researchers to expand the synthetic methods for advancing HCOFs with detailed solid-state structures, as well as designing porous organic framework materials with dynamic sorption capabilities to enhance their performance for applications in molecular storage, separation, catalysis, etc. © 2022 by the Author(s).

 Abstract:  Magnesium and its alloys are the most investigated materials for solid-state hydrogen storage in the form of metal hydrides, but there are still unresolved problems with the kinetics and thermodynamics of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of this group of materials. Severe plastic deformation (SPD) methods, such as equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP), high-pressure torsion (HPT), intensive rolling, and fast forging, have been widely used to enhance the activation, air resistance, and hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics of Mg-based hydrogen storage materials by introducing ultrafine/nanoscale grains and crystal lattice defects. These severely deformed materials, particularly in the presence of alloying additives or second-phase nanoparticles, can show not only fast hydrogen absorption/desorption kinetics but also good cycling stability. It was shown that some materials that are apparently inert to hydrogen can absorb hydrogen after SPD processing. Moreover, the SPD methods were effectively used for hydrogen binding-energy engineering and synthesizing new magnesium alloys with low thermodynamic stability for reversible low/room-temperature hydrogen storage, such as nanoglasses, high-entropy alloys, and metastable phases including the high-pressure γ-MgH2 polymorph.

 Abstract:  Storage of hydrogen is a necessary prerequisite for the commercialisation of hydrogen used in the production of energy. The solid-state storage of hydrogen is one of the many different methods for storing hydrogen, requiring much research. This work aims to optimise the desorption temperature and kinetic characteristics of MgH2 by introducing Be doping at varying concentrations using density functional theory within the WIEN2k code. Gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity increases as the Be concentration increases. Formation energy, cohesive energy and desorption temperature improve with the doping of Be. Elastic constants are then used to determine which hydrides are mechanically stable. All of the hydrides, except for MgBe3H8, meet the Born stability conditions, which means that they are mechanically stable. The bonding characteristics, shear modulus, bulk modulus, Cauchy pressures and Vicker’s hardness test are all measured and analysed. These hydrides can be classified as semiconductors based on their electronic properties, and bandgap values decrease with the concentration of Be. Many previously undiscovered thermodynamic features of these hydrides are examined and presented.

The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area and total pore volume of the TPA-DHTP-BZ POP were 195 m2 g−1 and 0.53 cm3 g−1, respectively. The poly(TPA-DHTP-BZ) POP showed an impressive CO2 capture performance of 3.29 mmol g−1 and a specific capacitance of 67.1 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. After thermal ring-opening polymerization, a solid-state chemical transformation, the resulting poly(TPA-DHTP-BZ) POP featured Mannich bridges and phenolic groups that formed strong inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, thereby enhancing the electrochemical and CO2 capture properties. Therefore, poly(TPA-DHTP-BZ) POP has the potential to be employed in practical applications for CO2 capture and as an efficient electrode for energy storage. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  This study aims to investigate the structural, electronic, mechanical, piezoelectric, and lattice dynamic proprieties of Ammonia monochloroborane NH3BH2Cl, using first-principles calculations. Both density functional theory and density functional perturbation theory are employed in the computations with generalized gradient approximation and plane waves pseudo-potential formalism. The calculated lattice constants and atomic positions are found in good agreement compared to the experimental values reported in the literature with a deviation of less than 2.85%. The determined density of states reveals that NH3BH2Cl can be considered as an insulator with a wide bandgap of 5.5 eV. Both total and partial density of states, electron local function (ELF), and Born effective charge have been computed to analyse the chemical bond nature of the studied compound. The obtained results indicate the existence of a strong covalent chemical bonding between B and H to form hydric B–H part δ‒, and between N and H to form protic part δ+ in NH3BH2Cl compound. Electronic, dielectric, piezoelectricity and elastic tensors, and vibration modes in Gamma point are calculated and analysed for the first time. The results reveal that NH3BH2Cl is mechanically and dynamically stable. Finally, this study demonstrates that NH3BH2Cl compound can be potentially used as hydrogen storage medium with a capacity of ∼8.5 wt%, besides in piezoelectric (a large value of d15) and wide bandgap devices. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen is a promising alternative to fossil fuels that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Decoupled water electrolysis system using a reversible proton storage redox mediator, where the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction are separated in time and space, is an effective approach to producing hydrogen gas with high purity, high flexibility, and low cost. To realize fast hydrogen production in such a system, a redox mediator capable of releasing protons rapidly is required. Herein, α-MoO3, with an ultrafast proton transfer property that can be explained by a dense hydrogen bond network in the lattice oxygen arrays of HxMoO3, is examined as a high-rate redox mediator for fast hydrogen production in acidic electrolytes. The α-MoO3 redox mediator shows both a large capacity of 204 mAh g−1 and fast hydrogen production at a current rate of 10 A cm−2(≈153 A g−1), outperforming most of the previously reported solid-state redox mediators. © 2023 The Authors.

 Abstract:  While MgH2 has been widely regarded as a promising solid-state hydrogen storage material, the high operating temperature and sluggish kinetics pose a major bottleneck for its practical application. Herein, V4Nb18O55 microspheres composed of nanoparticles with size of tens of nanometers are fabricated to promote H2 desorption and absorption properties of MgH2, which results in the uniform formation of Nb/V interfaces based on a molecular scale during the reversible hydrogen storage process. It is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated that the uniform building of Nb/V interfaces not only preserves the ability of Nb in weakening Mg-H bonds but also alleviates the strong adsorption capacity of metallic Nb toward hydrogen atoms, leading to a relative energy barrier for the whole dehydrogenation process of MgH2 of only 0.5 eV, which is 0.22 and 0.43 eV lower than that of Nb and V, respectively. As a result, under the addition of V4Nb18O55 microspheres, the onset H2 desorption temperature of MgH2 is decreased to 165 °C, 125 °C lower than that of bulk MgH2, and the complete hydrogenation of Mg could be realized even at room temperature, while almost no H2 adsorption is observed for bulk Mg at a high temperature of 50 °C. © 2022 The Authors.

 Abstract:  The high hydrogen storage capacity (10.5 wt.%) and release of hydrogen at a moderate temperature make LiAlH4 an appealing material for hydrogen storage. However, LiAlH4 suffers from slow kinetics and irreversibility. Hence, LaCoO3 was selected as an additive to defeat the slow kinetics problems of LiAlH4. For the irreversibility part, it still required high pressure to absorb hydrogen. Thus, this study focused on the reduction of the onset desorption temperature and the quickening of the desorption kinetics of LiAlH4. Here, we report the different weight percentages of LaCoO3 mixed with LiAlH4 using the ball-milling method. Interestingly, the addition of 10 wt.% of LaCoO3 resulted in a decrease in the desorption temperature to 70 °C for the first stage and 156 °C for the second stage. In addition, at 90 °C, LiAlH4 + 10 wt.% LaCoO3 can desorb 3.37 wt.% of H2 in 80 min, which is 10 times faster than the unsubstituted samples. The activation energies values for this composite are greatly reduced to 71 kJ/mol for the first stages and 95 kJ/mol for the second stages compared to milled LiAlH4 (107 kJ/mol and 120 kJ/mol for the first two stages, respectively). The enhancement of hydrogen desorption kinetics of LiAlH4 is attributed to the in situ formation of AlCo and La or La-containing species in the presence of LaCoO3, which resulted in a reduction of the onset desorption temperature and activation energies of LiAlH4. © 2023 by the authors.

 Abstract:  In this work, we studied the hydrogen adsorption capabilities of functionalized graphene sheets containing a variety of defects (D-G) via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that govern the mechanisms involved in hydrogen adsorption. Specifically, the graphene sheets containing monovacancy (MV), Stone-Wales (SW), and multiple double vacancy (DV) defects were functionalized with Ti and N atoms to enhance their hydrogen adsorption capacity. We measured the adsorption capacities of the N-/D-G sheets with varying concentrations of Ti adatoms at 300 K and 77 K temperatures and various pressures. Our study revealed that the increasing concentration of Ti adatoms on the D-G sheets led to a significant improvement in the hydrogen adsorption capacity of the graphene sheets. The DV(III)-G sheets showed the maximum adsorption capacity at 300 K because the DV(III)-G sheets had a small number of large-sized pores that bind hydrogen with high binding energy. Thus, hydrogen remained adsorbed even at higher temperatures (300 K). The N doping on the D-G sheets initially reduced their hydrogen adsorption capabilities; however, the N-D-G sheets enhanced their hydrogen adsorption capacity with the increasing concentrations of Ti adatoms. Compared to all other defect types, the Ti–N-DV(III)-G sheet with a Ti concentration of 10.5% showed a hydrogen uptake of 5.5 wt% at 300 K and 100 bar pressure. Thus, the N doping and Ti implantations improved the hydrogen storage capabilities of the graphene sheets, and these findings helped design solid-state hydrogen storage systems operating at ambient conditions and moderate pressure ranges. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

 Abstract:  Size-confined Si nanorods (NRs) have gained notable interest because of their tunable photophysical properties that make them attractive for optoelectronic, charge storage, and sensor technologies. However, established routes for fabrication of Si NRs use well-defined substrates and/or nanoscopic seeds as promoters that cannot be easily removed, hindering the investigation of their true potential and physical properties. Herein, we report a facile, one-step route for the fabrication of Si NRs via thermal disproportionation of hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) in the presence of a molecular tin precursor (SnCl4) at a substantially lower temperature (450 °C) compared to those used in the synthesis of size-confined Si nanocrystals (>1000 °C). The use of these precursors allows the facile isolation of phase-pure Si NRs via HF etching and subsequent surface passivation with 1-dodecene via hydrosilylation. The diameters (7.7-16.5 nm) of the NRs can be controlled by varying the amount of SnCl4 (0.2-3.0%) introduced during the HSQ synthesis. Physical characterization of the NRs suggests that the diamond cubic structure is not affected by SnCl4, HF etching, and hydrosilylation. Surface analysis of NRs indicates the presence of Si0 and Sin+ species, which can be attributed to core Si and surface Si species bonded to dodecane ligands, respectively, and a systematic variation of the Si0:Si-C ratio with the NR diameter. The NRs show strong size confinement effects with solid-state absorption onsets (2.51-2.80 eV) and solution-state (Tauc) indirect energy gaps (2.54-2.70 eV) that can be tuned by varying the diameter (16.5-7.7 nm). Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) studies reveal size-dependent emission (1.95-2.20 eV) with short, nanosecond lifetimes across the visible spectrum, which trend closely with absorption trends seen in solid-state absorption data. The facile synthesis developed for size-confined Si NRs with high crystallinity and tunable optical properties will promote their application in optoelectronic, charge storage, and sensing studies. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) with a high hydrogen capacity of 10.5 wt% has become one of the most promising solid-state hydrogen storage materials for onboard hydrogen fuel cell systems. However, neither dehydrogenation kinetics nor cycling behaviors of LiAlH4 can fulfill the requirements of practical application. Here, we prepared the Ni/C nanoparticles anchored on large-size Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, firstly introduced into LiAlH4 to investigate its catalytic effect. Dehydrogenation experiments demonstrate that LiAlH4 doped with 7 wt% Ni/C@Ti3C2 starts to release hydrogen at 56.9 °C. Also, it can release about 4.3 wt% hydrogen within 50 min at 120 °C. The activation energies of LiAlH4 doped with 7 wt% Ni/C@Ti3C2 for the first and second steps are 34.5% and 53.2% lower than the as-received LiAlH4, respectively. Under 300 °C and 40 bar hydrogen, it can absorb 0.58 wt% hydrogen. It is found that in situ formed intermetallic Al2Ti during ball milling can weaken the Al-H bonds in LiAlH4 through interfacial charge transfer and the dehybridization, benefitting for the breaking of the Al-H bond in LiAlH4. In addition, Al2Ti can promote the adsorption and splitting of H2, contributing to the rehydrogenation of LiAlH4. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  The effect of Al addition on the structure, microstructure and hydrogen storage properties of the ternary TiVNb alloy was investigated from small amounts to equimolar composition. Alx(TiVNb)1−x (x = 0.05, 0.175 and 0.25) alloys are bcc single-phase materials with decreasing lattice parameters with increasing Al content. Al addition progressively decreases the hydrogen storage capacity but also destabilizes fcc dihydride formation for alloys with x ≤ 0.10. Among the different compositions, the most promising alloy was found to be that with x = 0.05 Al content that exhibited high initial storage capacity (2.96 wt.%), a less stable hydride (ΔH = −52 kJ/mol H2 and ΔS = −141 J/K∙mol H2), better desorption properties (desorption onset temperature around 100 °C) and enhanced reversible capacity during cycling (2.83 wt.%) compared to the ternary TiVNb. In situ and ex situ synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction, together with thermal desorption experiments, showed improved desorption properties with Al addition, together with a two-step reaction with hydrogen.

 Abstract:  Magnesium hydride (MgH2) has received outstanding attention as a safe and efficient material to store hydrogen because of its 7.6 wt.% hydrogen content and excellent reversibility. Nevertheless, the application of MgH2 is obstructed by its unfavorable thermodynamic stability and sluggish sorption kinetic. To overcome these drawbacks, ball milling MgH2 is vital in reducing the particle size that contribute to the reduction of the decomposition temperature. However, the milling process would become inefficient in reducing particle sizes when equilibrium between cold-welding and fracturing is achieved. Therefore, to further ameliorate the performance of MgH2, nanosized cobalt titanate (CoTiO3) has been synthesized using a solid-state method and was introduced to the MgH2 system. The different weight percentages of CoTiO3 were doped to the MgH2 system, and their catalytic function on the performance of MgH2 was scrutinized in this study. The MgH2 + 10 wt.% CoTiO3 composite presents the most outstanding performance, where the initial decomposition temperature of MgH2 can be downshifted to 275 °C. Moreover, the MgH2 + 10 wt.% CoTiO3 absorbed 6.4 wt.% H2 at low temperature (200 °C) in only 10 min and rapidly releases 2.3 wt.% H2 in the first 10 min, demonstrating a 23-times-faster desorption rate than as-milled MgH2 at 300 °C. The desorption activation energy of the 10 wt.% CoTiO3-doped MgH2 sample was dramatically lowered by 30.4 kJ/mol compared to undoped MgH2. The enhanced performance of the MgH2–CoTiO3 system is believed to be due to the in situ formation of MgTiO3, CoMg2, CoTi2, and MgO during the heating process, which offer a notable impact on the behavior of MgH2. © 2022 by the authors.

 Abstract:  Given the environmental concerns, scientists are exploring sustainable and eco-friendly energy sources over the years. Hydrogen (H2), a green fuel, stands as a promising candidate for the future. It is been stored as either gas-, liquid- or solid-state. Storing hydrogen in solid form, through either physisorption or chemisorption, promotes it for effective use in the transportation sector. Physisorption is completely reversible and exhibits rapid kinetics, but suffers from low operating temperatures. The weak van der Waals forces here cause a decrease in storage capacity with a rise in temperature. Chemisorption offers higher hydrogen storage capacities but constrained by slow kinetics and high dehydrogenation temperatures. At room temperature, the H2 storage capacity ranges from 0.14 to 8.8 wt% for materials under undoped to doped conditions. Various techniques like the spillover mechanism, chemical activation (for adsorption), and ball milling, using catalysts, nanoconfinement (for absorption) help improve the hydrogen uptake at room temperature.

 Abstract:  Aqueous zinc-ion hybrid capacitors (ZHCs) are receiving immense attention in view of their merits in energy/power density, water compatibility, and economy. However, achieving superior ZHCs is also extremely challenging due to the ineluctable dendrite and side reaction issues of Zn anodes and the unsatisfactory capacity of carbon cathodes. Herein, we report a molecular-level regulation strategy to eliminate the current barriers from Zn anodes by designing a polysaccharide-reinforced hydrogel electrolyte of polyacrylamide/carboxymethyl cellulose/xanthan gum/zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (PAM/CMC/XG/Zn(CF3SO3)2). The fabricated hydrogel electrolyte can efficiently prevent dendrite formation and protect Zn anodes from the water-caused corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction to achieve an extended life of the Zn//Zn cell over 230 h and a high average coulombic efficiency of 99.3% in the Zn//Cu cell. Additionally, a carbon fabric (GCNF), with a large surface area, N-doped structure, and plentiful microcrystalline regions, was finely designed as a binder-free cathode for aqueous ZHCs, which has a fairly high capacity of 173.8 mA h g−1 with excellent rate characteristics. And the quasi-solid-state ZHC composed of PAM/CMC/XG/Zn(CF3SO3)2 and GCNF demonstrates a high capacity retention of 93.5% over 10 000 cycles and an impressive energy density of 113.2 W h kg−1 at a power density of 206.2 W kg−1.

 Abstract:  Aqueous magnesium ion-based batteries have attracted significant research interest due to the two-electron transfer process, small cation radius, low reduction potential as well as the inert hydrogen evolution reaction.

In addition to energy storage performance, functionalized design of batteries with good mechanical properties and self-healing ability is critical to the development of flexible intelligent electronic devices. The polymer with quadruple hydrogen bonds can give materials the ability to repair mechanical damage and restore the original mechanical properties. The incorporation of inorganic fillers into polymer electrolytes can improve the electrochemical properties and stability of the electrolytes. Optimization of the geometry of inorganic materials could further improve the electrical conductivity of composite electrolytes. In this work, a flexible self-healing polymer electrolyte (Poly (ethylene glycol)-co-ureidopyrimidinone), PEG-UPy) was synthesized. Three different microstructures of SiO2 fillers (solid, mesoporous, and hollow mesoporous) with UPy modified were designed to improve the sodium ion transport performance of the PEG-UPy self-healing polymer electrolyte for sodium ion batteries. The PEG-UPy electrolyte filled with hollow mesoporous SiO2 (PEG-UPy@hSiO2) exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance due to its unique structure among the samples. The PEG-UPy@hSiO2 electrolyte shows the highest ionic conductivity, sodium ion transference number, and appropriate self-healing property. The discharge capacity of NVP/PEG-UPy@hSiO2-NaTFSI (HCPE)/Na cell could reach 110.5 mAh g−1 at 0.1C and the capacity retention rate could reach more than 77.6% after 200 cycles at 60 °C. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Reversible solid oxide cells based on proton conductors (P-ReSOCs) have potential to be the most efficient and low-cost option for large-scale energy storage and power generation, holding promise as an enabler for the implementation of intermittent renewable energy technologies and the widespread utilization of hydrogen. Here, the rational design of a new class of hexavalent Mo/W-doped proton-conducting electrolytes with excellent durability while maintaining high conductivity is reported. Specifically, BaMo(W)0.03Ce0.71Yb0.26O3-δ exhibits dramatically enhanced chemical stability against high concentrations of steam and carbon dioxide than the state-of-the-art electrolyte materials while retaining similar ionic conductivity. In addition, P-ReSOCs based on BaW0.03Ce0.71Yb0.26O3-δ demonstrate high peak power densities of 1.54, 1.03, 0.72, and 0.48 W cm−2 at 650, 600, 550, and 500 °C, respectively, in the fuel cell mode. During steam electrolysis, a high current density of 2.28 A cm−2 is achieved at a cell voltage of 1.3 V at 600 °C, and the electrolysis cell can operate stably with no noticeable degradation when exposed to high humidity of 30% H2O at −0.5 A cm−2 and 600 °C for over 300 h. Overall, this work demonstrates the promise of donor doping for obtaining proton conductors with both high conductivity and chemical stability for P-ReSOCs. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

 Abstract:  One of the ideal energy carriers for the future is hydrogen. It has a high energy density and is a source of clean energy. A crucial step in the development of the hydrogen economy is the safety and affordable storage of a large amount of hydrogen. Thus, owing to its large storage capacity, good reversibility, and low cost, Magnesium hydride (MgH2) was taken into consideration. Unfortunately, MgH2 has a high desorption temperature and slow ab/desorption kinetics. Using the ball milling technique, adding cobalt lanthanum oxide (LaCoO3) to MgH2 improves its hydrogen storage performance. The results show that adding 10 wt.% LaCoO3 relatively lowers the starting hydrogen release, compared with pure MgH2 and milled MgH2. On the other hand, faster ab/desorption after the introduction of 10 wt.% LaCoO3 could be observed when compared with milled MgH2 under the same circumstances. Besides this, the apparent activation energy for MgH2–10 wt.% LaCoO3 was greatly reduced when compared with that of milled MgH2. From the X-ray diffraction analysis, it could be shown that in-situ forms of MgO, CoO, and La2O3, produced from the reactions between MgH2 and LaCoO3, play a vital role in enhancing the properties of hydrogen storage of MgH2. © 2023 by the authors.

 Abstract:  Among the routes to perform hydrogen release from ammonia in solid state, the nanoconfinement into a carbonaceous matrix or the use of carbon-supported catalysts for the thermal degradation of ammonia borane (AB) is the most interesting one. Oxidized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) represent a suitable choice for preparing AB mixtures or for anchoring catalysts for dehydrogenation. Nevertheless, literature lacks detailed study about the influence of CNT oxidation degree on the AB degradation/hydrogen release. In this study, we first described in a comprehensive way that the thermal degradation of AB mixed with CNTs by varying the CNT oxidation degree enlightens the degradative routes mainly active in each case. Using highly oxidized CNTs, we observed a decrement of activation energy of the degradative process up to around 53% and the activation/suppression of different pathways based on the amount of oxygen functionalities present in the mixtures. Furthermore, the presence of oxidized CNTs modulated the solid-state reactivity of AB reducing the release of nitrogen/boron species together with hydrogen. These findings lead the way for the design of new hydrogen storage materials. © 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  Thermoplastic starch (TPS) consisting of corn starch and glycerol as a plasticizer, and TPS-montmorillonite (MMT) nanocomposite were stored at room temperature in the air with relative humidities (RH) of 11, 55 and 85% for seven weeks. Mechanical testing and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) were performed to detect changes in their mechanical properties. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy monitoring the changes in molecular mobility in the samples provided an insight into relations between mechanical properties and local structure. The results of mechanical testing indicated that the addition of MMT results in the increase in the tensile strength and Young’s modulus while elongation at break decreased, indicating the reinforcing effect of MMT. DMTA experiments revealed a decrease in glass transition temperature of starch-rich phase below room temperature for samples stored at higher RH (55 and 85%). This indicates that absorbed water molecules had additional plasticizing effect on starch resulting in higher mobility of starch chain segments. Recrystallization in these samples was deduced from the shape of cross-polarization magic-angle spinning 13C NMR spectra. The shape of broad-line 1H NMR spectra reflected changes in molecular mobility in the studied samples during seven weeks of storage and revealed that a high amount of water molecules impacts the starch intermolecular hydrogen bond density. © 2023 by the authors.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen energy is expected to be an “ideal fuel” in the era of decarbonization. The discovery, development, and modification of high-performance hydrogen storage materials are the keys to the future development of solid-state hydrogen storage and hydrogen energy utilization. Magnesium hydride (MgH2), with its high hydrogen storage capacity, abundant natural reserves, and environmental friendliness, has been extensively researched. Herein, we briefly summarize the typical structure and hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reaction mechanism of MgH2 and provide a comprehensive overview of strategies to effectively tune the thermodynamics and kinetics of Mg-based materials, such as alloying, nanosizing, the introduction of additives, and composite modification. With substantial efforts, great achievements have been achieved, such as lower absorption/desorption temperatures and better cycling stability. Nonetheless, some pivotal issues remain to be addressed, such as unfavorable hydrogenation/dehydrogenation factors, harsh conditions, slow kinetics, incomplete dehydrogenation, low hydrogen purity, expensive catalysts, and a lack of valid exploration of mechanisms in the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation process. Lastly, some future development prospects of MgH2 in energy-efficient conversion and storage have been presented, including advanced manufacturing ways, stabilization of nanostructures, the introduction of additives combined with structural modification, and utilization of advanced characterization techniques. © 2022

 Abstract:  In this study, we used effective and one-pot Heck coupling reactions under moderate reaction conditions to construct two new hybrid porous polymers (named OVS-P-TPA and OVS-P-F HPPs) with high yield, based on silsesquioxane cage nanoparticles through the reaction of octavinylsilsesquioxane (OVS) with different brominated pyrene (P-Br4), triphenylamine (TPA-Br3), and fluorene (F-Br2) as co-monomer units. The successful syntheses of both OVS-HPPs were tested using various instruments, such as X-ray photoelectron (XPS), solid-state 13C NMR, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses. All spectroscopic data confirmed the successful incorporation and linkage of P, TPA, and F units into the POSS cage in order to form porous OVS-HPP materials. In addition, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and N2 adsorption analyses revealed the thermal stabilities of OVS-P-F HPP (Td10 = 444 °C; char yield: 79 wt%), with a significant specific surface area of 375 m2 g–1 and a large pore volume of 0.69 cm3 g–1. According to electrochemical three-electrode performance, the OVS-P-F HPP precursor displayed superior capacitances of 292 F g−1 with a capacity retention of 99.8% compared to OVS-P-TPA HPP material. Interestingly, the OVS-P-TPA HPP showed a promising HER value of 701.9 µmol g−1 h−1, which is more than 12 times higher than that of OVS-P-F HPP (56.6 µmol g−1 h−1), based on photocatalytic experimental results. © 2022 by the authors.

 Abstract:  Metal hydrides such as MgH2 and NaBH4 are among the materials for with the highest potential solid-state hydrogen storage. However, unlike gas and liquid storage, a dehydrogenation process has to be done prior to hydrogen utilization. In this context, the hydrolysis method is one of the possible methods to extract or generate hydrogen from the materials. However, problems like the MgH2 passivation layer, high cost and sluggish self-hydrolysis of NaBH4 are the known limiting factors for this process, but they can be overcome with the help of catalysts. In this works, selected studies have been reviewed on the performance of catalysts like chloride, oxide, fluoride, platinum, ruthenium, cobalt and nickel-based on the MgH2 and NaBH4 system. These studies show a significant enhancement in the amount of hydrogen released as compared to the hydrolysis of the pure MgH2 and NaBH4. Therefore, the addition of catalysts is proven as one of the options in improving hydrogen generation via the hydrolysis of MgH2 and NaBH4. © 2022 by the authors.

 Abstract:  Although MgH2 is widely regarded as one of the most promising solid-state hydrogen storage materials, the high operating temperature and sluggish kinetics of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation are major challenges for its practical application. Herein, V6O13 nanobelts with a thickness of 11 nm are fabricated to promote the reversible hydrogen storage performance of MgH2. The favorable interaction between V6O13 nanobelts and MgH2 leads to in situ homogeneous formation of metallic V during the initial dehydrogenation of MgH2. Induced by the catalysis of metallic V, which results in weaker structural stability and higher surface states of MgH2 attributed to the strong bonding interactions between V and H, the energy required for H2 desorption from MgH2 is decreased to 49.5 kJ mol−1, 10.9 kJ mol−1 lower than that of pristine MgH2. Moreover, during the reversible hydrogenation process, the catalysis of metallic V lowers the energy for H2 adsorption and dissociation on Mg down to −5.904 and 0.023 eV, respectively, while those values reach −0.086 and 1.103 eV for pristine Mg. As a result, with the introduction of V6O13 nanobelts with an ultralow content of 3 wt%, a systematic hydrogen storage capacity of 6.8 wt% could be retained at 250 °C after 10 cycles. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Due to their high energy and power density, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have gained popularity in response to the demand for effective energy storage solutions. The importance of the electrode architecture in determining battery performance highlights the demand for optimization. By developing useful organic polymers, cyclodextrin architectures have been investigated to improve the performance of Li-based batteries.

 Abstract:  Direct pyrolysis of low-cost and resource-abundant pitch generally produces highly graphitized soft carbon, showing low reversible capacity and a negligible charge-discharge plateau owing to its unsuitable microstructure for sodium storage. Herein, for the first time, an innovative dual-interfering chemistry strategy is proposed to solve the soft-hard carbon translation challenge. Multifunctional zinc gluconate generates dual-mechanism interference upon decomposition and successfully regulates pitch pyrolysis: 1) the gas decomposition products (carbon oxides) may consume excess hydrogen to realize fusion-to-solid-state pyrolysis of pitch, hindering microcrystalline ordering; 2) the solid compounds (i.e., organic zinc salt and ZnO nanoparticles) not only weakens strong π–π interactions between the aromatic chains of pitch but also introduces abundant closed pores into the carbon matrix. The optimized pitch-derived hard carbon (PZHC 450–1200) shows an absorption-insertion-pore filling sodium storage mechanism after microstructure conversion from graphitic structure to a pore-rich and turbostratic structure. As a result, the PZHC 450–1200 exhibits a high reversible capacity of 320 mAh g−1 at 30 mA g−1 with a more than twofold-enhanced low-voltage plateau capacity ratio, and outstanding rate capability that outperforms almost all previously reported pitch-derived carbons.

More importantly, the Ar-NiFe/NC electrocatalyst also shows a remarkable operational and storage stability. After accelerated durability test (ADT) cycles, no obvious degradation of oxygen electrocatalytic performance could be observed. In addition, the Ar-NiFe/NC electrocatalyst still exhibits an unbated oxygen electrocatalytic performance comparable to fresh catalysts after three months of air-exposed storage.

 Abstract:  Over the last few decades, hydrogen fuel has been considered to be a major alternative source of renewable energy due to increasing environmental pollution and the depletion of nonrenewable energy. The need to efficiently produce and store hydrogen, therefore, has necessitated the development of several technologies and materials for hydrogen storage to achieve the envisaged hydrogen economy. Solid-state hydrogen storage in magnesium hydride (MgH2) has shown a huge potential owing to its impressively high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen capacities of ca. 7.6 wt% and 111 g/L, respectively. However, the bottleneck to the wide applications of MgH2 as a commercial source of hydrogen fuel is the delivery temperature requirement of ca. 300-400°C due to thermodynamic stability (ca. 76 kJ/mol-H2), and the slow kinetics of hydrogen de/absorption. Nanostructuring and catalysis are marked as the most promising strategies for modifying the properties of MgH2. Doping MgH2 with nanoscale materials can lower the delivery temperature and bring it nearer to commercial applications. Recently, MXenes, a group of 2D nanomaterials composed of transition metal carbides/nitrides/carbonitrides layers, have demonstrated the dual roles of storing hydrogen and enhancing the hydrogen evolution reactions of lightweight metal hydrides especially MgH2.

 Abstract:  Expanding pollution and rapid consumption of natural reservoirs (gas, oil, and coal) led humankind to explore alternative energy fuels like hydrogen fuel. Solid-state hydrogen storage is most desirable because of its usefulness in the onboard vehicle. In this work, we explored the yttrium decorated ultra porous, two-dimensional holey-graphyne for hydrogen storage. Using the first principles density functional theory simulations, we predict that yttrium doped holey graphyne can adsorb up to seven hydrogen molecules per yttrium atom resulting in a gravimetric hydrogen weight percentage of 9.34, higher than the target of 6.5 wt% set by the US Department of Energy. The average binding energy per H2 and desorption temperature come out to be -0.34 eV and ∼438 K, respectively. Yttrium atom is bonded strongly on HGY sheet due to charge transfer from Y 4d orbital to C 2p orbital whereas the adsorption of H2 molecule on Y is due to Kubas-type of interactions involving charge donation from H 1s orbital to Y 3d orbital and back donation with net charge gain by H 1s orbital. Furthermore, sufficient energy barriers for the metal atom diffusion have been found to prevent the clustering of transition metal (yttrium) on HGY sheet. The stability of the system at higher temperatures is analyzed using Ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) method, and the system is found to be stable at room and the highest desorption temperature. Stability of the system at higher temperatures, presence of adequate diffusion energy barrier to prevent metal-metal clustering, high gravimetric wt% of H2 uptake with suitable binding energy, and desorption temperature signifies that Y doped HGY is a promising material to fabricate high capacity hydrogen storage devices.  © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.

 Abstract:  Recently, high-entropy alloys (HEAs) designed by the concepts of unique entropy-stabilized mechanisms, started to attract widespread interests for their hydrogen storage properties. HEAs with body-centered cubic (BCC) structures present a high potential for hydrogen storage due to the high hydrogen-to-metal ratio (up to H/M = 2) and vastness of compositions. Although many studies reported rapid absorption kinetics, the investigation of hydrogen desorption is missing, especially in BCC HEAs. We have investigated the crystal structure, microstructure and hydrogen storage performance of a series of HEAs in the Ti–V–Nb–Cr system. Three types of TiVCrNb HEAs (Ti4V3NbCr2, Ti3V3Nb2Cr2, Ti2V3Nb3Cr2) with close atomic radii and different valence electron concentrations (VECs) were designed with single BCC phase by CALPHAD method. The three alloys with fast hydrogen absorption kinetics reach the H/M ratio up to 2. Particularly, Ti4V3NbCr2 alloy shows the hydrogen storage capacity of 3.7 wt%, higher than other HEAs ever reported. The dehydrogenation activation energy of HEAs’ hydride has been proved to decrease with decreasing VEC, which may be due to the weakening of alloy atom and H atom. Moreover, Ti4V3NbCr2M (M = Mn, Fe, Ni) alloys were also synthesized to destabilize hydrides. The addition of Mn, Fe and Ni lead to precipitation of Laves phase, however, the kinetics did not improve further because of their own excellent hydrogen absorption. With increasing the content of Laves phase, there appear more pathways for hydrogen desorption so that the hydrides are more easily dissociated, which may provide new insights into how to achieve hydrogen desorption in BCC HEAs at room temperature. © 2022, The Author(s).

"Seperate the questions with commasTitle:Amorphous alloys for hydrogen storage
 Abstract:  Metal hydrides are promising materials for solid-state hydrogen storage, however, their gravimetric hydrogen storage density is generally low. In addition, they may also exhibit poor activity, sluggish de/hydrogenation kinetics and high thermodynamic stability, in particular for metal hydrides with high storage capacity. Because of the long-range disordered atomic structure, the amorphous structure, showing a wider interstitial configuration diversity, can provide hydrogen with more types of occupation sites. Such unique property leads to much larger hydrogen storage capacity, faster de/hydrogenation kinetics, local thermodynamic destabilization and even destruction resistance. Therefore, making use of amorphous structure is one of the attractive strategies for promoting the performance of metal hydrides. To develop amorphous hydrogen storage alloys, composition design is the first issue, and two main factors should be considered. One is the glass forming ability of alloys and the other is hydrogen storage ability of the alloys. Comparing with the crystalline counterparts, the amorphous hydrogen storage alloys exhibit some unique features: (1) the non-Arrhenius hydrogen diffusion; (2) the deviation from the Sieverts’ law; (3) protean hydrogen-induced phase separation/crystallization; (4) plateau-free pressure-composition-isothermal curve; (5) excessed storage capacity; etc. Till now, the developed hydrogen storage amorphous alloys are mainly Ti-based, Zr-based and Mg-based alloys. Some amorphous alloys do show attractive performance. In particular, Mg-based amorphous alloys have been investigated extensively in recent years. The hydrogen storage capacity in Mg-based amorphous alloys can be readily higher than 3.0 wt%-H, and with addition of other elements, one can also obtain reasonable de/hydrogenation rate and temperature during electrochemical or gaseous process. Though the de/hydrogenation capacity and kinetics of the amorphous alloys can be much better than the crystalline counterparts, there are still great challenges, such as amorphous structure stability, long-cycle reversible de/hydrogenation and irreversible hydrogen-induced amorphous phase transformation. With further exploration of alloy composition and material processing, there are great chances in using hydrogen storage amorphous alloys as energy storage material. © 2023

 Abstract:  Hydrogen energy has been recognized as “Ultimate Power Source” in the 21st century, which could be the best solution to the looming energy crisis and climate degeneration in the near future. Due to its high safety, low price, abundant resources and decent hydrogen storage density, magnesium based solid-state hydrogen storage materials are becoming the leading candidate for onboard hydrogen storage. However, the high operation temperature and slow reaction rate of MgH2, as a result of the large formation enthalpy and high reaction activation energy, respectively, are the first and most difficult problems we need to face and overcome to realize its industrialization.

 Abstract:  Vanadium-based alloys are considered to be one of the most promising hydrogen storage materials due to their high hydrogen storage capacity under ambient conditions. However, their complex activation at high temperature and poor stability pose serious challenges for large-scale applications. In this work, a series of TiCr3V16Cex (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 1) hydrogen storage alloys were developed with different Ce contents using arc melting. The hydrogen storage and desorption performance, activation mechanism, and hydrogen absorption mechanism of the prepared alloys were investigated. Physical characterization confirms that the alloy is body-centered cubic (BCC) with Ce dopants, which exist in the form of oxides. The pressure-composition-temperature (PCT) test showed that the hydrogen storage plateau pressure of the Ce-doped alloy is increased compared to the Ce-free counterparts, while the hydrogen storage capacity decreased slightly with increasing Ce content. In addition, the influence of Ce doping on the alloy kinetics and thermodynamics is also discussed. The results showed that the TiCr3V16Cex (x = 0.2, 0.4, 1) alloys could absorb and release hydrogen at room temperature without activation. As an optimum, the TiCr3V16Ce0.2 alloy shows a hydrogen absorption rate of up to 3.69 wt%, and an effective hydrogen desorption capacity of 2.29 wt% at 25 °C. After hydrogen absorption and desorption cycles, the alloy almost maintains its original capacity.

 Abstract:  As classical BCC structure solid state hydrogen storage materials, vanadium-based solid solution alloys occupied a prominent position in the field of hydrogen storage materials due to their significant advantages such as the ability to absorb and desorb hydrogen with high capacity under moderate conditions. In this paper, RE-containing medium entropy BCC solid solution alloys were designed. The microstructure, phase composition and hydrogen storage properties of the medium entropy alloys were systematically studied. Microstructural analysis showed that nanoscale crystals were found in as-cast medium entropy alloys obtained by arc melting followed by natural cooling inside the furnace. This is different from the vanadium-based alloys that are often regarded as traditional coarse-grained alloys in the past decades. The V47Fe11Ti30Cr10RE2 alloys can be fully activated by one cycle of hydrogen ab/de-sorption after pretreatment. The kinetic test shows that the time required for the as-cast RE-containing medium entropy alloys hydrogen uptake to 90% saturation is less than 100 s at room temperature. The alloys exhibit very excellent hydrogen absorption kinetic properties than reported alloys takes at least about 300 s. This is due to the fact that the present alloys are composed of nanocrystals with numerous interfaces and grain boundaries, and these defects can act as good channels for the diffusion of hydrogen atoms. The V47Fe11Ti30Cr10Y2 alloy exhibits a maximum capacity of 3.41 wt% at 295 K.

 Abstract:  Slush hydrogen is a mixture of liquid hydrogen and solid hydrogen particles, and considered as an attractive propulsion fuel. The preparation process of slush hydrogen is complex. This paper describes a slush hydrogen preparation device which enables hydrogen liquefaction, liquid hydrogen storage, liquid hydrogen transfer, pumping decompression of liquid hydrogen, slush hydrogen observation, and hydrogen emission. In an open area, many tests using liquid hydrogen are conducted. The results show that 1) The scheme of hydrogen liquefaction using two-stage Gifford- Mcmahon (G-M) refrigerator is feasibility, and the liquefying rate of hydrogen is 0.45 L/h, which meets the consumption of slush hydrogen preparation. 2) In the triple-phase point state, average pressure and temperature of liquid hydrogen are measured as 7.1 kPa and 14.03 K respectively. Compared with NIST physical property data, the relative errors of pressure and temperature are 3.4% and 0.5%, respectively. 3) The formation process of solid hydrogen by the pumping decompression is observed. It is found that the solid hydrogen first nucleates on the Dewar wall. With the continuous run of the vacuum pump, the solid hydrogen gradually grows until dense solid hydrogen is formed, resulting that the light could not pass through it. It indicates that liquid hydrogen in the area near the gas–liquid interface could be completely frozen by the pumping decompression method. 4) The formation of slush hydrogen by a freezing-melting method is observed. It is found that the solid hydrogen forms porous structures due to the boiling fluctuation of liquid hydrogen during the freezing process, and the porous solid hydrogen in the liquid hydrogen forms a fragment or sheet shape again under the boiling action of liquid hydrogen during the melting process. When the vacuum pump is opened again, the violent boiling of the liquid hydrogen causes the fragmented solid hydrogen in the liquid hydrogen to be broken into irregular solid hydrogen particles again. Under the action of Gibbs free energy, irregular solid hydrogen particles form small spherical solid hydrogen particles suspended in liquid hydrogen. 5) Three states of liquid hydrogen, solid hydrogen in liquid hydrogen and slush hydrogen are visually compared. It is found that the observed slush hydrogen is a turbid and viscous state, which is a solid–liquid mixture of tiny solid hydrogen particles suspended in liquid hydrogen. At the same time, the weak motion behavior of viscous fluid is also observed. 6）The leakage heat of the slush hydrogen Dewar is calculated as 4.13 W by the liquid level drop rate, which is 1.66 times of the theoretical calculation, and it could provide a technical reference for the design of liquid hydrogen Dewar. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

 Abstract:  Abstract: Hydrogen storage and release using a solid-state material e.g., sodium borohydride (NaBH4) may fulfill the requirements for the ‘Hydrogen Economy’. This study reported ZnO-based materials for hydrogen release via the hydrolysis of NaBH4. Two different metal oxides e.g. CeO2 and TiO2 with different weight loading (5 wt.% and 10 wt.%) were used during the synthesis via a simple combustion method. The synthesis procedure offered nanocomposites consisting of ZnO-xTiO2, and ZnO-xCeO2 (x = 5 wt.% or 10 wt.%). Diffraction techniques (X-ray (XRD) and electron diffraction (ED)) confirm the phase purity of the material. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and photoluminescence spectroscopy characterized the optical properties of the materials. The materials displayed a hydrogen generation rate (HGR) of 3000 mL·min−1·gcat−1.

 Abstract:  Solid-state hydrogen storage is the best choice for balancing economy and safety among various hydrogen storage technologies, and hydrogen storage in the secondary phase might be a promising solid-state hydrogen storage scheme. In the current study, to unmask its physical mechanisms and details, a thermodynamically consistent phase-field framework is built for the first time to model hydrogen trapping, enrichment, and storage in the secondary phases of alloys. The hydrogen trapping processes, together with hydrogen charging, are numerically simulated using the implicit iterative algorithm of the self-defined finite elements. Some important results are attained: 1. Hydrogen can overcome the energy barrier under the assistance of the local elastic driving force and then spontaneously enter the trap site from the lattice site. The high binding energy makes it difficult for the trapped hydrogens to escape. 2. The secondary phase geometry stress concentration significantly induces the hydrogen to overcome the energy barrier. 3. The manipulation of the geometry, volume fraction, dimension, and type of the secondary phases is capable of dictating the tradeoff between the hydrogen storage capacity and the hydrogen charging rate. The new hydrogen storage scheme, together with the material design ideology, promises a viable path toward the optimization of critical hydrogen storage and transport for the hydrogen economy. © 2023 by the authors.

 Abstract:  Magnesium hydride has great potential as a solid hydrogen (H) storage material because of its high H storage capacity of 7.6 wt%. However, its slow hydrogenation and dehydrogenation kinetics and the high temperature of 300 ∘C required for decomposition are major obstacles to small-scale applications such as automobiles. The local electronic structure of interstitial H in MgH2 is an important fundamental knowledge in solving this problem, which has been studied mainly based on density functional theory (DFT). However, few experimental studies have been performed to assess the results of DFT calculations. We have therefore introduced muon (Mu) as pseudo-H into MgH2 and investigated the corresponding interstitial H states by analyzing their electronic and dynamical properties in detail. As a result, we observed multiple Mu states similar to those observed in wide-gap oxides, and found that their electronic states can be attributed to relaxed-excited states associated with donor/acceptor levels predicted by the recently proposed ‘ambipolarity model’. This provides an indirect support for the DFT calculations on which the model is based via the donor/acceptor levels. An important implication of the muon results for improved hydrogen kinetics is that dehydrogenation, serving as a reduction for hydrides, stabilises the interstitial H− state. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.

 Abstract:  This article reports the hydrogenation properties of a TiFe0.85Cr0.15 alloy prepared by gas atomization on one hand, and vacuum arc-remelting on the other hand for demonstration and reference, respectively. To evidence the excellent potential of ternary alloying combined with gas atomization process for improving the first hydrogen absorption kinetics, both the atomized powders and the reference crushed ingots were exposed to air from 1 h to as long as 10 days. In spite of the resulting surface oxide layer formation, all specimens still absorbed hydrogen partly thanks to the presence of the C14 Laves phase. As expected, the first hydrogenation kinetics decreased with increasing air-exposure time, but atomized powders not only outperformed the reference counterparts but also remained quite competitive despite surface oxidation. The remarkable kinetic enhancement observed was attributed to the formation of an additional Ti2Fe phase, to an increased amount of C14 Laves phase, as well as to a fine microstructure resulting from the rapid cooling rate involved in gas atomization. Even though different absorption behaviors were observed for all samples, the reaction mechanisms derived from solid-gas reaction models were ascribed to interface- and diffusion-controlled 3D processes in the early and subsequent stage of the first hydrogenation, respectively. © 2022 The Authors

 Abstract:  The sustainable production of methane (CH4) via the electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) is an appealing approach to simultaneously mitigating carbon emissions and achieving energy storage in chemical bonds. Copper (Cu) is a unique material to produce hydrocarbons and oxygenates. However, selective methane generation on Cu remains a great challenge due to the preferential *CO dimerization pathway toward multi-carbon (C2+) products at neighboring catalytic sites. Herein, a conjugated copper phthalocyanine polymer (CuPPc) is designed by a facile solid-state method for highly selective CO2-to-CH4 conversion. The spatially isolated CuN4 sites in CuPPc favor the *CO protonation to generate the key *CHO intermediate, thus significantly promoting the formation of CH4. As a result, the CuPPc catalyst exhibits a high CH4 Faradaic efficiency of 55% and a partial current density of 18 mA cm−2 at −1.25 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode.

 Abstract:  Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is the most feasible and effective solid-state hydrogen storage material, which has excellent reversibility but initiates decomposing at high temperatures and has slow kinetics performance. Here, zinc titanate (Zn2TiO4) synthesised by the solid-state method was used as an additive to lower the initial temperature for dehydrogenation and enhance the re/dehydrogenation behaviour of MgH2. With the presence of Zn2TiO4, the starting temperature for the dehydrogenation of MgH2 was remarkably lowered to around 290 °C–305 °C. In addition, within 300 s, the MgH2–Zn2TiO4 sample absorbed 5.0 wt.% of H2 and 2.2–3.6 wt.% H2 was liberated from the composite sample in 30 min, which is faster by 22–36 times than as-milled MgH2. The activation energy of the MgH2 for the dehydrogenation process was also downshifted to 105.5 kJ/mol with the addition of Zn2TiO4 indicating a decrease of 22% than as-milled MgH2. The superior behaviour of MgH2 was due to the formation of MgZn2, MgO and MgTiO3, which are responsible for ameliorating the re/dehydrogenation behaviour of MgH2. These findings provide a new understanding of the hydrogen storage behaviour of the catalysed-MgH2 system. © 2023

 Abstract:  Nanoscaled catalysts have attracted much more attention due to their more abundant active sites and better dispersion than their bulky counterparts. In this work, VHx nanoparticles smaller than 10 nm in average size are successfully synthesized by a simple solid-state ball milling coupled with THF washing process, which are proved to be highly effective in enhancing the hydrogen absorption/desorption kinetics of MgH2 at moderate temperatures. The nano-VHx-modified MgH2 releases hydrogen from 182 °C, which is 88 °C lower than additive-free MgH2. The release of hydrogen amounts to 6.3 wt% H within 10 min at 230 °C and 5.6 wt% H after 30 min at 215 °C with initial vacuum. More importantly, the dehydrogenated MgH2+10 wt.% nano-VHx rapidly absorbs 5.2 wt% H within 3 min at 50 °C under 50 bar H2. It even takes up 4.3 wt% H within 30 min at room temperature (25 °C) under 10 bar H2, exhibiting superior hydrogenation kinetics to most of the previous reports.

 Abstract:  The mass storage of hydrogen is a challenge considering large industrial applications and continuous distribution, e.g., for domestic use as a future energy carrier that respects the environment. For a long time, molecular hydrogen was stored and distributed, either as a gas (pressurized up to 75 MPa) or as a cryogenic liquid (20.4 K). Furthermore, the atomic storage of hydrogen in the solid-state form via metallic or covalent compounds is still the subject of intense research and limited to a small scale for some practical developments. In addition, other type H chemical storage routes are being tested, such as ammonia and LOHC (Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier), etc. In any case, the main constraint remains security. However, Hydrogen Solid State Storage (HSSS) using MgH2 bodies has been shown to be feasible in terms of process and safety. Furthermore, its intrinsic volumetric densification was proven to be much better performing with 106:70:45 kgH2/m3 for solid (RT):LH (20.4 K):gas (75 MPa), respectively. Very early on, fairly reactive MgH2-based pellets were produced (for max. ~27 tons/year) at McPhy Energy using a series of unique and self-built installations. Thus, the design of large instrumented reservoirs was undertaken thanks to fundamental research first carried out at the CNRS. So, prototypes of storage units from 100 to ~5500 kWh have been produced. However, McPhy took other routes a few years ago (smelting and refueling stations) because the HSSS market was not merging at that time. Today, a new operator, Jomi–Leman, therefore, decided to try the challenge again focusing on applications with on-site production and mass HSSS. © 2023 by the authors.

 Abstract:  Yarn-shaped supercapacitors (SCs) functionalized with pseudocapacitive materials show promise in wearable electronics. However, their development was hindered by poor electrochemical properties, especially long-term cycling stability, owing to the volumetric change during charging/discharging. Herein, we report a ship-in-a-bottle architecture on carbon nanotube yarn (CNTY) based SCs, in which transition metal hydroxide (TMH) nanoparticles (Ni(OH)2 or Co(OH)2) are confined in conducting nanoporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs, Ni3(HITP)2) which anchor onto CNTY, involves the synergy of nanoconfinement and hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) network to mutually support each phase toward improved electrochemical performance. The Ni(OH)2@Ni3(HITP)2@CNTY electrode possesses an areal specific capacitance of 496 mF cm−2 at 0.4 mA cm−2 due to the hierarchical structure which led to facilitated charge transport and enhanced ion storage. Moreover, the ternary CNTY-based SCs demonstrate exceptional cycle performance (90.9-92.3% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles at 5 mA cm−2). Importantly, the nanoconfinement is confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and cryogenic-TEM characterization studies. The H-bonding (O⋯H-N) network between Ni(OH)2 and Ni3(HITP)2 is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Both nanoconfinement and the H-bonding network contribute to an ultra-stable Ni(OH)2@Ni3(HITP)2 structure due to its high durability to volumetric change caused by phase separation and structural collapse during charging/discharging. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Despite high interest in compact and safe storage of hydrogen in the solid-state hydride form, the design of alloys that can reversibly and quickly store hydrogen at room temperature under pressures close to atmospheric pressure is a long-lasting challenge. In this study, first-principles calculations are combined with experiments to develop high-entropy alloys (HEAs) for room-temperature hydrogen storage. TixZr2-xCrMnFeNi (x = 0.4-1.6) alloys with the Laves phase structure and low hydrogen binding energies of -0.1 to -0.15 eV are designed and synthesized. The HEAs reversibly store hydrogen in the form of Laves phase hydrides at room temperature, while (de)hydrogenation pressure systematically reduces with increasing the zirconium fraction in good agreement with the binding energy calculations. The kinetics of hydrogenation are fast, the hydrogenation occurs without any activation or catalytic treatment, the hydrogen storage performance remains stable for at least 1000 cycles, and the storage capacity is higher than that for commercial LaNi5. The current findings demonstrate that a combination of theoretical calculations and experiments is a promising pathway to design new high-entropy hydrides with high performance for hydrogen storage. © 2022

 Abstract:  Despite the application of lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH4) being hindered by its sluggish desorption kinetics and unfavourable reversibility, LiAlH4 has received special attention as a promising solid-state hydrogen storage material due to its hydrogen storage capacity (10.5 wt.%). In this work, investigated for the first time was the effect of the nanosized cobalt titanate (CoTiO3) which was synthesised via a solid-state method on the desorption behaviour of LiAlH4. Superior desorption behaviour of LiAlH4 was attained with the presence of a CoTiO3 additive. By means of the addition of 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt.% of CoTiO3, the initial desorption temperature of LiAlH4 for the first stage was reduced to around 115–120 °C and the second desorption stage was reduced to around 144–150 °C, much lower than for undoped LiAlH4. The LiAlH4-CoTiO3 sample also presents outstanding desorption kinetics behaviour, desorbing hydrogen 30–35 times faster than undoped LiAlH4. The LiAlH4-CoTiO3 sample could desorb 3.0–3.5 wt.% H2 in 30 min, while the commercial and milled LiAlH4 desorbs <0.1 wt.% H2. The apparent activation energy of the LiAlH4-CoTiO3 sample based on the Kissinger analysis was decreased to 75.2 and 91.8 kJ/mol for the first and second desorption stage, respectively, lower by 28.0 and 24.9 kJ/mol than undoped LiAlH4. The LiAlH4-CoTiO3 sample presents uniform and smaller particle size distribution compared to undoped LiAlH4, which is irregular in shape with some agglomerations. The experimental results suggest that the CoTiO3 additive promoted notable advancements in the desorption performance of LiAlH4 through the in situ-formed AlTi and amorphous Co or Co-containing active species that were generated during the desorption process. © 2022 by the authors.

 Abstract:  High energy density and low cost make lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries as one of the next generation’s promising energy storage systems.

 Abstract:  Superfunctional materials are defined as materials with specific properties being superior to the functions of engineering materials. Numerous studies introduced severe plastic deformation (SPD) as an effective process to improve the functional and mechanical properties of various metallic and non-metallic materials. Moreover, the concept of ultra-SPD—introducing shear strains over 1000 to reduce the thickness of sheared phases to levels comparable to atomic distances—was recently utilized to synthesize novel superfunctional materials. In this article, the application of ultra-SPD for controlling atomic diffusion and phase transformation and synthesizing new materials with superfunctional properties is discussed. The main properties achieved by ultra-SPD include: (i) high-temperature thermal stability in new immiscible age-hardenable aluminum alloys; (ii) room-temperature superplasticity for the first time in magnesium and aluminum alloys; (iii) high strength and high plasticity in nanograined intermetallics; (iv) low elastic modulus and high hardness in biocompatible binary and high-entropy alloys; (v) superconductivity and high strength in the Nb-Ti alloys; (vi) room-temperature hydrogen storage for the first time in magnesium alloys; and (vii) superior photocatalytic hydrogen production, oxygen production, and carbon dioxide conversion on high-entropy oxides and oxynitrides as a new family of photocatalysts. © 2023 by the author.

 Abstract:  Flexible aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) require high conductive and adhesive hydrogel electrolytes. However, high adhesion tends to hinder ion conduction rate. Herein, we designed a water/glycerol binary solvent coordinating the hydrophilic polymers to reconstruct the water molecules' environment in the hydrogel. As a consequence, the interface adhesion strength between Zn and the hydrogel reached 3.0 kPa and the ionic conductivity was up to 16.8 mS cm−1. In addition, inspired by the slurry electrode preparation method, we developed a simple blade coating technique using a non-Newtonian polysaccharide liquid solution to construct an ultra-thin hydrogel electrolyte in situ on the cathode. The thickness of the obtained hydrogel reached 70 μm, and the ultrathin flexible AZIBs were easily constructed by pasting a Zn anode directly on the adhesive hydrogel, showing the potential of flexible AZIBs scalable assembly. In addition, the Zn//Zn symmetrical cells with the hydrogel electrolyte provided stable cycling performance for over 400 h at 0.1 mA cm−2 with suppressed dendrite growth. The assembled Zn//Polyaniline battery and Zn//V2O5 battery also exhibited excellent capacity retention after cycles.

 Abstract:  Lead-free bismuth layered structured ferroelectric ceramics are highly important in superior energy storage applications. The slim hysteresis curve with high energy storage density and efficiency is expected for wide application. In this regard, the suitable electrocatalyst for the generation of hydrogen gas through water-splitting show high importance as an alternative energy source. The current article aims to investigate the above goals by incorporating 5% yttrium at the place of bismuth for BaBi2Nb2O9 relaxor ferroelectrics. The solid-state synthesized method successfully prepared the single-phase material and is confirmed through spectroscopic and morphological analysis. The dielectric characteristics follow diffused phase transition with broad temperature dependence that indicated the space charge polarization in the material owing to the presence of Y3+ at different domains. The higher degree of diffuseness and low dielectric loss implies the significant role of charge carriers during frequency and temperature variation in the dielectric study. Impedance spectroscopy analysis indicates the non-Debye type relaxation and NTCR behavior of the material that is correlated to the multiple relaxation processes. The slim P-E hysteresis curve and fatigue-free properties of the materials up to 106 cycles reflect its usefulness in the potential device as NVRAM applications. The materials are also used for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under an electrochemical condition. A lower overpotential value of 180 mV is obtained at 10 mA cm−2 current density.

The novel CoMoO4/rGO catalyst was subsequently doped into MgH2 to improve its hydrogen storage performance. MgH2–10 wt% CoMoO4/rGO starts to release hydrogen at around 204 °C, which is about 36 °C and 156 °C lower than that of MgH2 −10 wt%CoMoO4 and pure MgH2, respectively. In addition, 6.25 wt% H2 can be released within 10 min at 300 °C. After complete dehydrogenation, H2 can be absorbed below 80 °C. Meanwhile, it can absorb 4.2 wt% H2 in 20 min under the condition of 150 °C and 3 MPa. Moreover, the activation energy of hydrogen absorption and dehydrogenation of MgH2–10 wt%CoMoO4/rGO composites are reduced by 31.44 kJ mol−1 and 33.78 kJ mol−1, respectively, compared with pure MgH2.

 Abstract:  Magnesium hydrides (MgH2) have drawn a lot of interest as a promising hydrogen storage material option due to their good reversibility and high hydrogen storage capacity (7.60 wt.%). However, the high hydrogen desorption temperature (more than 400 °C) and slow sorption kinetics of MgH2 are the main obstacles to its practical use. In this research, nickel zinc oxide (Ni0.6Zn0.4O) was synthesized via the solid-state method and doped into MgH2 to overcome the drawbacks of MgH2. The onset desorption temperature of the MgH2–10 wt.% Ni0.6Zn0.4O sample was reduced to 285 °C, 133 °C, and 56 °C lower than that of pure MgH2 and milled MgH2, respectively. Furthermore, at 250 °C, the MgH2–10 wt.% Ni0.6Zn0.4O sample could absorb 6.50 wt.% of H2 and desorbed 2.20 wt.% of H2 at 300 °C within 1 h. With the addition of 10 wt.% of Ni0.6Zn0.4O, the activation energy of MgH2 dropped from 133 kJ/mol to 97 kJ/mol. The morphology of the samples also demonstrated that the particle size is smaller compared with undoped samples.

 Abstract:  Lithium metal batteries are highly pursued for energy storage applications due to superior energy densities. However, fast battery decay accompanied by lithium dendrite growth occurs mainly owing to solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) failure. To address this, a novel functional quasi-solid-state polymer electrolyte is developed through in situ copolymerization of a cyclic carbonate-containing acrylate and a urea-based acrylate monomer in commercial available electrolyte. Based on the rigid-tough coupling design of SEI, anionic polymerization of cyclic carbonate units and reversible hydrogen bonding formed using urea motifs on the polymer matrix can take place at SEI. This mechanically stabilizes SEI and thus helps achieve uniform lithium deposition behaviors and non-dendrite growth. Thus, the superior cycling performance of LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2/Li metal batteries is promoted by the formation of compatible SEI. This design philosophy to build mechanochemically stable SEI provides a good example for realizing advanced lithium metal batteries. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

The initial desorption temperature of NaAlH4 catalysed by different weight percentage of CoTiO3 (5 wt%, 10 wt%, 15 wt% and 20 wt%) was dramatically decreased to around 130–160 °C for the first desorption stage and decreased to around 182–198 °C for the second desorption stage, which is lower than milled NaAlH4. The composite sample also exhibits 15–18 times faster desorption kinetics at 150 °C where the NaAlH4-CoTiO3 composite could release 3.0–3.7 wt% of H2 in 60 min but milled NaAlH4 only could release 0.2 wt% H2 in the same time duration. The activation energies for the two-desorption stage of NaAlH4 was downshifted to 85.5 and 91.6 kJ/mol, lowered by 30.7 and 35.5 kJ/mol than milled NaAlH4, respectively. The beneficial catalytic effect of CoTiO3 can be attributed to the in-situ formation of Al-Co and Al-Ti alloys after the desorption process of the NaAlH4-CoTiO3 system. These findings pave the way for the development of highly effective catalysts for NaAlH4 as a favourable material for hydrogen storage. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  LiAlH4 is considered as a promising material for solid state hydrogen storage. However, the lack of reversibility along with sluggish kinetics hinders its practical application. In this paper, hollow carbon nanospheres (HCNs) were used as a porous scaffold to confine LiAlH4 via solvent impregnation method. Nanoconfined LiAlH4 (LiAlH4@HCNs) exhibited significant improvements in hydrogen sorption compared to its bulk counterpart. LiAlH4@HCNs releases hydrogen sharply at 146 °C with full conversion to LiH within 1.5 h. The desorbed material can also be regenerated back to some extent into LiAlH4 under 8 MPa H2 at 150 °C. Measurement of the pressure-composition isotherm suggests an alteration in the equilibrium state upon confinement of LiAlH4 in voids of a few nanometres and thus altered hydrogen thermodynamic paths. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Quinine (an antimalarial) and aspirin (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) were combined into a new drug-drug salt, quininium aspirinate, C20H25N2O2 +·C9H7O4 -, by liquid-Assisted grinding using stoichiometric amounts of the reactants in a 1:1 molar ratio, and water, EtOH, toluene, or heptane as additives. A tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of the mechanochemical product prepared using EtOH as additive led to a single crystal of the same material obtained by mechanochemistry, which was used for crystal structure determination at 100K. Powder X-ray diffraction ruled out crystallographic phase transitions in the 100-295K interval. Neat mechanical treatment (in a mortar and pestle, or in a ball mill at 20 or 30Hz milling frequencies) gave rise to an amorphous phase, as shown by powder X-ray diffraction; however, FT-IR spectroscopy unambiguously indicates that a mechanochemical reaction has occurred. Neat milling the reactants at 10 and 15Hz led to incomplete reactions. Thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry indicate that the amorphous and crystalline mechanochemical products form glasses/supercooled liquids before melting, and do not recrystallize upon cooling. However, the amorphous material obtained by neat grinding crystallizes upon storage into the salt reported.

 Abstract:  The use of Mg-based compounds in solid-state hydrogen energy storage has a very high prospect due to its high potential, low-cost, and ease of availability. Today, solid-state hydrogen storage science is concerned with understanding the material behavior of different compositions and structure when interacting with hydrogen. Finding a suitable material has remained an elusive idea, and therefore, this review summarizes works by various groups, the milestones they have achieved, and the roadmap to be taken on the study of hydrogen storage using low-cost magnesium composites. Mg-based compounds are further examined from the perspective of artificial intelligence studies, which helps to improve prediction of their properties and hydrogen storage performance. There exist several techniques to improve the performance of Mg-based compounds: microstructure modification, use of catalytic additives, and composition regulation. Microstructure modification is usually achieved by employing different synthetic techniques like severe plastic deformation, high energy ball milling, and cold rolling, among others. These synthetic approaches are discussed herein. In this review, a discussion of key parameters and operating conditions are highlighted in a view to finding high storage capacity and faster kinetics. Furthermore, recent approaches like machine learning have found application in guiding the experimental design. Hence, this review paper also explores how machine learning techniques have been utilized to fasten the materials research.

 Abstract:  Alongside the generation of renewable power and its storage in batteries, hydrogen technologies are essential to enable a deep decarbonization of the energy system. These technologies include solid oxide cells (SOCs), which can be operated as electrolyzers to generate hydrogen or syngas and/or for power supply in fuel cell mode and demonstrate the highest electrical efficiency among electrochemical converters. However, SOCs like other energy technologies contain significant amounts of critical raw materials, which should be preserved appropriately. Therefore, the development of economically viable recycling strategies is required even at an early market entry stage. In this paper, potential recycling routes for SOC stack components are discussed. Based on state-of-the-art materials and cell designs, the future challenges related to SOC recycling are outlined, and possible recycling pathways for all SOC components are presented with an emphasis on the ceramic fractions. Their economic and environmental potentials are evaluated, showing the significant advantages offered by recycling. © 2022 The Authors. Advanced Energy Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.

 Abstract:  LiBH4 as a promising candidate material for solid-state hydrogen storage still suffers from high dehydrogenation temperature and poor reversibility. A catalyzed LiBH4-based system with in situ introduced Li3BO3 and V is synthesized by adding NH4VO3 into LiBH4 followed by a heat treatment and a hydrogenation process. The optimized LiBH4 system introduced with 0.06 molar fraction of Li3BO3 + V, which is denoted as LiBH4–0.06LiBOV, shows excellent hydrogen storage kinetics and high reversible stability. The system starts to release hydrogen at 220 °C, and a capacity of 5.8 wt % H2 is obtained at 350 °C within 90 min. Furthermore, full rehydrogenation can be achieved at 500 °C and 50 bar of H2 for 50 min, and a capacity retention as high as 87.5% is obtained after five cycles. In situ introduced Li3BO3 and V lower the activation energy of LiBH4 and inhibit the generation of Li2B12H12 during the hydrogenation of LiBH4, which contribute to the synergistic catalytic effects on hydrogen desorption and absorption. In addition, the restraining of the particle size growth during dehydrogenation/hydrogenation is critical to inhibiting the generation of Li2B12H12 and thus improves the hydrogenation property of LiBH4. The catalyzed LiBH4 system provides new insights on LiBH4 as a high-density hydrogen storage material. © 2022 American Chemical Society

 Abstract:  Complex metal hydrides are a fascinating and continuously expanding class of materials with many properties relevant for solid-state hydrogen and ammonia storage and solid-state electrolytes. The crystal structures are often investigated using powder X-ray diffraction (PXD), which can be ambiguous. Here, we revisit the crystal structure of Y(11BD4)3·3ND3 with the use of neutron diffraction, which, in comparison to previous PXD studies, provides accurate information about the D positions in the compound. Upon cooling to 10 K, the compound underwent a polymorphic transition, and a new monoclinic low-temperature polymorph denoted as α-Y(11BD4)3·3ND3 was discovered. Furthermore, the series of Y(11BH4)3·xNH3 (x = 0, 3, and 7) were also investigated with inelastic neutron scattering and infrared spectroscopy techniques, which provided information of the local coordination environment of the 11BH4- and NH3 groups and unique insights into the hydrogen dynamics. Partial deuteration using ND3 in Y(11BH4)3·xND3 (x = 3 and 7) allowed for an unambiguous assignment of the vibrational bands corresponding to the NH3 and 11BH4- in Y(11BH4)3·xNH3, due to the much larger neutron scattering cross section of H compared to D. The vibrational spectra of Y(11BH4)3·xNH3 could roughly be divided into three regions: (i) below 55 meV, containing mainly 11BH4- librational motions, (ii) 55-130 meV, containing mainly NH3 librational motions, and (iii) above 130 meV, containing 11B-H and N-H bending and stretching motions.  ©

 Abstract:  In the search for energy storage materials, metal octahydrotriborates, M(B3H8)n, n = 1 and 2, are promising candidates for applications such as stationary hydrogen storage and all-solid-state batteries. Therefore, we studied the thermal conversion of unsolvated Mg(B3H8)2 to BH4- as-synthesized and in the presence of MgH2. The conversion of our unsolvated Mg(B3H8)2 starts at â 100 °C and yields â 22 wt % of BH4- along with the formation of (closo-hydro)borates and volatile boranes. This loss of boron (B) is a sign of poor cyclability of the system. However, the addition of activated MgH2 to unsolvated Mg(B3H8)2 drastically increases the thermal conversion to 85-88 wt % of BH4- while simultaneously decreasing the amounts of B-losses. Our results strongly indicate that the presence of activated MgH2 substantially decreases the formation of (closo-hydro)borates and provides the necessary H2 for the B3H8-To-BH4 conversion. This is the first report of a metal octahydrotriborate system to selectively convert to BH4- under moderate conditions of temperature (200 °C) in less than 1 h, making the MgB3H8-MgH2 system very promising for energy storage applications.  ©

 Abstract:  Zinc metal anode-based batteries (ZMBs) are regarded as promising substitutes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in large-scale energy storage devices and wearable electronics due to their merits of intrinsic safety, cost-effectiveness and abundant reserves. However, many challenges in the electrolyte module system hinder the practical applications of ZMBs, including the dendrite growth, corrosion, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and passivation in aqueous-based electrolytes (ABEs) and low ionic conductivity in gel or solid-state electrolytes (SSEs). This review focuses on advanced electrolyte engineering to solve the above issues and summarizes the latest strategies to construct an efficient and stable electrode-electrolyte interface by optimizing ABEs and developing neoteric SSEs. The modifications of ABEs are systematically reviewed from four aspects: introducing electrolyte additives, developing highly or local highly concentrated electrolytes, designing the structure of gel electrolytes, and employing solid-state electrolytes.

 Abstract:  Metallic hydride clusters have greater importance due to its unique physicomechanical properties. For solid-state hydrogen storage, (HfH2)n clusters has been considered a promising candidate because of high hydrogen capacity, low cost and larger interacting affinity between atoms. The structural and electronic properties of (HfH2)n clusters are investigated by employing the density functional theory. From the DFT calculations, it is found that Hf atom occupies central position while H atoms tends to occupy at vertex spots. Through structural stability analysis, the calculated binding energy and second order energy difference of (HfH2)n clusters increases from (HfH2)5 through (HfH2)30. The charge density distribution and results of Bader analysis revealed ionic bonding character between Hf and H atoms and transfer of electrons is observed from Hf to H atoms.

 Abstract:  Researchers have been working for many years to find new material and cell systems that can be used as potential post-lithium-ion batteries. Among these, the all-solid-state battery is considered a promising candidate, with sulfide-based materials having essential advantages over other solid electrolyte materials, particularly in terms of their high ionic conductivity. A great challenge, however, is their high reactivity in contact with water, where harmful hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is formed. Since H2S formation has implications for both worker safety and material quality, it is important to quantify its impact. For this reason, this paper examines the relationship between the product properties and the H2S formation as well as influences resulting from the production environment. Exemplary material states along the process chain of a wet coating process route are analyzed for the steps of storage, mixing, coating, drying, and densifying with Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) as a solid electrolyte material. By determining the H2S formation rate for sulfide-based separator sheets, it is shown that the water content in the surrounding atmosphere has the highest impact, while other investigated parameters are negligibly small in comparison. Among the product properties, the geometric surface and pore surface have a great influence. These results demonstrate the need for a controlled atmosphere in the production facilities at dew points of -40 to -50 °C. At those moisture levels, occupational safety and product quality are ensured for the investigated solid electrolyte sheets of LPSCl. This study is the first to provide quantitative data from the point of view of the production environment on the formation of H2S gas when using solid sulfide electrolytes and can therefore serve as a guideline for equipment, material, and cell manufacturers. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Solid hydrogen storage and supply systems with high density in a hydrogen refueling station are the critical factor to realize large-scale application of hydrogen energy, and one of the biggest challenges is how to ameliorate the extremely large pressure hysteresis of Ce-rich rare-earth-based metal hydrides. In this work, two series of La-Ce-Ca-Ni-Co alloys with single CaCu5-Type structure and uniformly distributed elements were prepared via induction levitation melting. With increasing Co content in La0.3Ce0.5Ca0.2Ni5-xCox(x = 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) alloys, a staged phase transformation occurs, contributing to a significant improvement in the pressure hysteresis without the monotonical sacrifice of dehydrogenation equilibrium pressure. An equilibrium-state thermal analysis method (ETA) is proposed and well verifies the thermodynamical phase transformation processes. Further first-principles calculations indicate that the enhanced charge synergy and increased charge transfer drive the conversion of staged phase transformation from dynamic to thermodynamically stable pathways. Thus, ""dynamically staged phase transformation"", nominated as the dynamic realization of thermodynamic staged phase transformation, is more constructive for practical use. Consequently, the optimal composition of La0.25Ce0.55Ca0.2Ni4.5Co0.5was developed with a saturated hydrogen storage capacity of 1.52 wt %, dehydrogenation equilibrium pressure of 10.68 MPa at 90 °C, and satisfactory cycling durability.

 Abstract:  All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) with inorganic solid electrolytes (SEs) have received much attention as future energy storage systems owing to their high energy densities and excellent safety. Sulfide-based SEs are considered promising because they exhibit greater ionic conductivities and mechanical softness than oxide-based SEs. In particular, argyrodite-type Li6PS5Cl with a high ionic conductivity of 3.0 × 10-3 S cm-1 offers new possibilities for realizing high-performance ASSBs. However, contact with moisture results in the evolution of H2S from Li6PS5Cl, which has hindered the scalable fabrication and practical application of Li6PS5Cl. To avoid this issue, we propose incorporating a zeolite, which can act as a scavenger for both toxic H2S gas and moisture, as a functional additive in Li6PS5Cl. We demonstrate that zeolite-embedded Li6PS5Cl exhibits greatly improved chemical stability and reduced H2S evolution upon storage in humid air (RH 50%), leading to a noticeable improvement in the cycle performance of ASSBs. This approach could resolve the technical issues associated with sulfide-based SEs toward commercial-scale implementation. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Formic acid (HCOOH) is an important intermediate in chemical synthesis, pharmaceuticals, the food industry, and leather tanning and is considered to be an effective hydrogen storage molecule. Direct contact with its vapor and its inhalation lead to burns, nerve injury, and dermatosis. Thus, it is critical to establish efficient sensing materials and devices for the rapid detection of HCOOH. In the present study, we introduce a chemical sensor based on a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor capable of detecting trace amounts of HCOOH. This sensor is composed of colloidal phenyl-terminated carbon nitride (Ph-g-C3N4) quantum nanoflakes prepared using a facile solid-state method involving the supramolecular preorganization technology. In contrast to other synthetic methods of modified carbon nitride materials, this approach requires no hard templates, hazardous chemicals, or hydrothermal treatments. Comprehensive characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the QCM sensor designed and prepared here exhibits enhanced detection sensitivity and selectivity for volatile HCOOH, which originates from chemical and hydrogen-bonding interactions between HCOOH and the surface of Ph-g-C3N4. According to DFT results, HCOOH is located close to the cavity of the Ph-g-C3N4 unit, with bonding to graphitic carbon and pyridinic nitrogen atoms of the nanoflake. The sensitivity of the Ph-g-C3N4-nanoflake-based QCM sensor was found to be the highest (128.99 Hz ppm-1) of the substances studied, with a limit of detection (LOD) of HCOOH down to a sub-ppm level of 80 ppb.

 Abstract:  Zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor (ZHSC), emerging as a promising energy storage device, bring together the benefits of the high power density of supercapacitors, the high energy density of batteries and the environmental and cost benefits of zinc-ion technology. However, the development of high energy density ZHSC working in a wide temperature range is still a challenge. The key to achieve this target is to develop the electrolyte with thermal stability and anti-freezing property which is compatible with the advanced cathode material. Herein, a natural biomass coconut shell derived activated carbon as cathode and cost-effective aqueous Zn(ClO4)2 as electrolyte are applied in aqueous ZHSC. The fabricated aqueous ZHSC exhibits an outstanding high energy density of 190.3 W h/kg at 89.8 W/kg. Furthermore, a robust flexible quasi-solid-state ZHSC device was constructed by using a cross-linked poly(vinyl alcohol)/montmorillonite/Zn(ClO4)2 gel electrolyte (PVA/MMT/Zn(ClO4)2), which shows superior electrochemical performance over a wide working temperature range. Experimental analysis and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the Zn(ClO4)2 process faster ionic migration compared to other Zn-based salts and form more hydrogen bonds with H2O, leading to a superior anti-freezing property. Our flexible device maintains the high energy storage capacities and excellent cycling stability over a wide temperature range from − 50 to 80 °C, suggesting its great potential applications for energy storage applications in harsh environmental conditions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

 Abstract:  Shear-thickening fluids that absorb the impact energy of high-velocity projectiles are of great interest for aerospace and body-armor applications. In such a frame, we investigate transient states of neat and aqueous polyelectrolytes (PE) having low molecular weights and containing poly([2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium) as polycations and poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) as polyanions. We compare results with those of bulk water. We employ nonequilibrium molecular dynamics to simulate oscillatory shear, mainly in the linear viscoelastic regime. We find that neat PE exhibits properties of a viscoelastic solid, whereas water and the aqueous mixture of PE conform to viscoelastic liquids with Maxwellian behavior at low angular frequencies. Terminal relaxation times are ∼0.499 and ∼1.385 ps for water and the aqueous mixture of PE, respectively. At high angular frequencies, storage moduli show anomalous behaviors that correspond to transitions between shear thinning and shear thickening in complex shear viscosities. The change in potential energy with the increase of the angular frequency is mainly driven by intramolecular interactions for neat PE, whereas short-range Coulomb interactions are the major contributions for water and the aqueous mixture of PE. Upon observation of the molecular configurations, only the local polyionic structure in the aqueous mixture of PE shows improvement when increasing the angular frequency, whereas the rest remains barely affected. Thus, the water structure in the aqueous mixture of PE allows the storage of energy elastically through the hydrogen-bond network at large angular frequencies, whereas the mechanical contribution of polyions weakens and fully vanishes at the beginning of shear thinning, explaining the superimposed data with data of bulk water. Our method and findings set the path for future molecular simulations in the nonlinear viscoelastic regime with more complex underlying molecular mechanisms. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  TiFe intermetallic compound has been extensively studied, owing to its low cost, good volumetric hydrogen density, and easy tailoring of hydrogenation thermodynamics by elemental substitution. All these positive aspects make this material promising for large-scale applications of solid-state hydrogen storage. On the other hand, activation and kinetic issues should be amended and the role of elemental substitution should be further understood. This work investigates the thermodynamic changes induced by the variation of Ti content along the homogeneity range of the TiFe phase (Ti:Fe ratio from 1:1–1:0.9) and of the substitution of Mn for Fe between 0 and 5 at%. In all considered alloys, the major phase is TiFe-type together with minor amounts of TiFe2 or β-Ti-type and Ti4Fe2O-type at the Ti-poor and rich side of the TiFe phase domain, respectively. Thermodynamic data agree with the available literature but offer here a comprehensive picture of hydrogenation properties over an extended Ti and Mn compositional range. Moreover, it is demonstrated that Ti-rich alloys display enhanced storage capacities, as long as a limited amount of β-Ti is formed. Both Mn and Ti substitutions increase the cell parameter by possibly substituting Fe, lowering the plateau pressures and decreasing the hysteresis of the isotherms. A full picture of the dependence of hydrogen storage properties as a function of the composition will be discussed, together with some observed correlations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Extensive research has been carried on the molecular adsorption in high surface area materials such as carbonaceous materials and MOFs as well as atomic bonded hydrogen in metals and alloys. Clathrates stand among the ones to be recently suggested for hydrogen storage. Although, the simulations predict lower capacity than the expected by the DOE norms, the additional benefits of clathrates such as low production and operational cost, fully reversible reaction, environmentally benign nature, low risk of flammability make them one of the most promising materials to be explored in the next decade. The inherent ability to tailor the properties of clathrates using techniques such as addition of promoter molecules, use of porous supports and formation of novel reverse micelles morphology provide immense scope customisation and growth. As rapidly evolving materials, clathrates promise to get as close as possible in the search of “holy grail” of hydrogen storage. This review aims to provide the audience with the background of the current developments in the solid-state hydrogen storage materials, with a special focus on the hydrogen clathrates. The in-depth analysis of the hydrogen clathrates will be provided beginning from their discovery, various additives utilised to enhance their thermodynamic and kinetic properties, challenges in the characterisation of hydrogen in clathrates, theoretical developments to justify the experimental findings and the upscaling opportunities presented by this system.

 Abstract:  Magnesium hydride (MgH2 ) has received significant attention due to its potential applications as solid-state hydrogen storage media for useful fuel cell applications. Even though MgH2 possesses several attractive hydrogen storage properties, it cannot be utilized in fuel cell applications due to its high thermal stability and poor hydrogen uptake/release kinetics. High-energy ball milling, and mechanically-induced cold-rolling processes are the most common techniques to introduce severe plastic deformation and lattice imperfection in the Mg/MgH2 . Furthermore, using one or more catalytic agents is considered a practical solution to improve both the de-/rehydrogenation process of MgH2 .These treatments are usually dedicated to enhance its hydrogen storage properties and deduce its thermal stability. However, catalyzation of Mg/MgH2 powders with a desired catalytic agent using ball milling process has shown some disadvantages due to the uncontrolled distribution of the agent particles in the MgH2 powder matrix. The present study has been undertaken to employ a cold gas-dynamic spray process for catalyzing the fresh surfaces of mechanically-induced cold-rolled Mg ribbons with Ni powder particles. The starting Mg-rods were firstly heat treated and forged 200 times before cold rolling for 300 passes. The as-treated ribbons were then catalyzed by Ni particles, using cold gas-dynamic spray process. In this catalyzation approach, the Ni particles were carried by a stream of Ar gas via a high-velocity jet at a supersonic velocity. Accordingly, the pelted Ni particles penetrated the Mg-substrate ribbons, and hence created numerous micropores into the Mg, allowed the Ni particles to form a homogeneous network of catalytic active sites in Mg substrate. As the number of coating time increased to three times, the Ni concentration increased (5.28 wt.%), and this led to significant enhancement of the Mg-hydrogen storage capacity, as well as improving the de-/rehydrogenation kinetics. This is evidenced by the high value of hydrogen storage capacity (6.1 wt.% hydrogen) and the fast gas uptake kinetics (5.1 min) under moderate pressure (10 bar) and temperature (200◦ C). The fabricated nanocomposite MgH2/5.28 wt.% Ni strips have shown good dehydrogenation behavior, indicated by their capability to desorb 6.1 wt.% of hydrogen gas within 11 min at 200◦ C under 200 mbar of hydrogen pressure. Moreover, this system possessed long cycle-life-time, which extended to 350 h with a minimal degradation in the storage and kinetics behavior. © 2021 by the authors.

 Abstract:  Objective: To investigate the effect of silane contents on their chemical interaction with 10-methacryloyloxydecyl-dihydrogen phosphate (MDP), and affecting the bonding of MDP to zirconia by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy. Methods: Zirconia (Cercon ht, Dentsply) slabs were prepared and fully sintered. Experimental primers SE-5 and SE-10 were formulated by adding 5 wt% and 10 wt% γ-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane to an MDP-based primer SE BOND (SE), respectively. SE, SE-5, and SE-10 were applied on the assigned zirconia slabs. The chemical compositions on the surface and adhesive interfaces were examined by TOF-SIMS in a depth-profiling mode. Hydrophilicity and resin affinity of treated zirconia were analyzed. The bond strengths to resin cylinder were examined either after 24-h storage or thermocycles. In addition, zirconia powders treated with three primers were assessed by SSNMR spectrometry for the adsorption of MDP. Results: TOF-SIMS analysis showed that SE treatment generated the greatest amount of P-O-Zr related ions, which reduced in SE-5 and SE-10 groups. The 3D ion-images illustrated the generation of ZrO2(OH)- ions with silane contents. The SSNMR analysis revealed that the chemical bonding was mainly P-O-Zr ionic bonds in SE but shifted to P-OH-Zr hydrogen bonds in SE-5 and SE-10. SE-5 and SE-10 treated zirconia presented higher hydrophilicity and affinity to resin compared to Zr did. SE showed the highest initial bond strength which significantly decreased after thermocycling. Significance: MDP adsorption onto zirconia via P-O-Zr ionic bond promotes bonding with resin. The silane enhances the hydroxylation of zirconia and impairs the adsorption of MDP, but does not adversely affect the bond durability. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

 Abstract:  The use of solid electrolytes can fundamentally change energy storage systems due to their higher safety and energy density. Herein, we design hydrogen-bonded polyethylene oxide (PEO) composite solid electrolytes (CSEs), which are hydrolyzed by tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in alkaline solution to form SiO2 with rich hydroxyl groups on its surface. This in situ formed SiO2 can not only reduce the crystallinity of PEO and increase the ionic conductivity (1.8 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 30 °C), but also adsorb anions so as to increase the lithium-ion transference number (tLi+ = 0.42). More importantly, hydrogen bonding can be formed with PEO, LITFSI and succinonitrile to form an interconnected network to improve the mechanical strength (Young's modulus = 0.72 GPa). In addition, we avoid the poor film formability and low mechanical strength by adjusting the ratio of EO : Li to 30 : 1 to reduce the content of lithium salt in the CSEs. Due to the high mechanical strength, the critical current density of lithium symmetrical batteries is as high as 1.4 mA cm-2. Using this CSE, a solid state LiFePO4‖Li battery delivers a high discharge capacity of 161.2 mA h g-1 at 0.5C with a capacity retention of 88% after 400 cycles at 30 °C. The in situ formed highly dispersed SiO2 reinforced PEO with abundant hydrogen bonds enables high performance of solid-state lithium batteries at room temperature.  © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Mg-Ni (150 nm) bilayer thin films were effectively prepared using the magnetron co-sputtering technique onto the glass and ITO coated glass substrates. In order to get homogeneity in the prepared thin film, annealing of the samples was made at 573 K for an one hour in the vacuum. Afterwards films were hydrogenated at 30 psi H2 for one hour. The optical, electrical and structural properties of Mg-Ni thin film were studied using UV–vis spectroscopy, Keithley electrometer, Hall Effect measurement and Field emission scanning electron microscopy(FESEM) along with energy dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). The optical bandgap of as-deposited thin film was found 3.85 eV and after annealing it was decreased to 3.79 eV. Furthermore, bandgap increment has been observed for annealed hydrogenated thin films and it was 3.91 eV. The Hall Effect measurements and I-V characteristics of samples show the semiconducting nature (n-type) of the films and the conductivity increases after annealing and decreases after hydrogenation of the annealed sample. Further, the Hall Effect measurements indicate increment in the Hall mobility of annealed thin films where as it is found to be decreased after hydrogenation of the annealed samples. FE-SEM images represent uniform deposition of thin film. The composition of elements was recorded through energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX). Accumulation of hydrogen, particularly at the thin film's interface, blocks the flow of electrons that results in decreased conductivity of thin film after hydrogenation. Therefore, it may be concluded that Mg-NI thin films are suitable for solid state hydrogen storage. © 2022

 Abstract:  Porous silicon powder has been fabricated from an Al–Si alloy by etching in strong acids, and its hydrogen storage capacity has been studied. Double acid etching in the fabrication and nickel blending have been proposed to further enhance the hydrogen storage capacity of the etched powder. The etching effectively removed the aluminum from the Al–Si alloy to form a porous Si structure, with a large increase in surface area. After charging under a hydrogen pressure of 3.7 MPa at 150 °C, the hydrogen uptake of double-etched and Ni-blend porous silicon samples was 0.81 wt%, which was >13 times higher than that of the as-received Al–Si alloy (0.06 wt%). The percentage of retained hydrogen after desorption was also largely decreased.

 Abstract:  In this work, the synthesis of β-AlF3-x(OH)xnanoparticles with very high specific surface area (SSA) using a microwave-assisted solvothermal process is reported. The influence of synthesis parameters on the morphology and SSA was investigated, and the nature of the solvent is shown to have the greatest impact. Five samples prepared using different solvent mixtures were deeply characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), N2sorption, powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and19F and27Al high-field solid-state NMR. Their SSAs range from 25 to 345 m2·g-1with an associated OH content slightly increasing from ≈16% (AlF2.52(OH)0.48) to ≈19% (AlF2.42(OH)0.58), as estimated by TGA and27Al high-field solid-state NMR. Compared to previous reference work [Dambournet, D., Chem. Mater.2008, 2041459−1469], β-AlF3-x(OH)xnanoparticles with SSAs up to 4 times larger were obtained.

 Abstract:  With a dual strategy of phase-interface engineering, monolayer (1L)-1T-WSe2integrated with Ag2Se nanoparticles (NPs) is in situ fabricated as quasi-monolayer Ag2Se/1L-1T-WSe2hybrid nanosheets via a one-pot oleylamine-colloidal reaction. The Ag2Se NPs direct the growth of 1L-1T-WSe2nanosheets forming the quasi-monolayer hybrid nanosheets by lodging in the interlayer spaces of WSe2while the Ag2Se NPs being in a superionic conductor state diffuse rapidly and prevent the growth of piled-up multilayered WSe2nanosheets. Due to the formation of quasi-monolayer Ag2Se/1L-1T-WSe2nanosheets, many more side edges are exposed. Intensive studies illustrated that the quasi-monolayer Ag2Se/1L-1T-WSe2hybrid nanosheets provide increased surface area and active sites as compared with isolated Ag2Se and WSe2. The hybrid nanosheets demonstrated excellent catalytic properties for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with overpotentials (η10) of 163 and 140 mV in acidic and basic conditions, respectively, and an outstanding alkaline supercapacitance of 1674 F g-1at 1 A g-1.

 Abstract:  With the development of consumer electronic devices and electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are vital components for high energy storage with great impact on our modern life. However, LIBs still cannot meet all the essential demands of rapidly growing new industries. In pursuance of higher energy requirement, metal batteries (MBs) are the next-generation high-energy-density devices. Li/Na metals are considered as an ideal anode for high-energy batteries due to extremely high theoretical specific capacity (3860 and 1165 mAh g−1 for Li and Na, respectively) and low electrochemical potential (−3.04 V for Li and −2.71 V for Na vs. standard hydrogen electrode). Unfortunately, uncontrolled dendrite growth, high reactivity, and infinite volume change induce severe safety concerns and poor cycle efficiency during their application. Consequently, MBs are far from commercialization stage. This Review represents a comprehensive overview of failure mechanism of lithium/sodium metal anode and its progress for rechargeable batteries through (i) electrolyte optimization, (ii) artificial solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer formation, and (iii) nanoengineering at materials level in current collector, anode, and host.

 Abstract:  MgH2 is considered one of the most promising candidates for solid-state hydrogen storage. However, the dehydrogenation of MgH2 generally happens at temperatures above 250 °C even after catalyzing and/or nano-confining modifications, thus embarrassing the practical use of MgH2 in fuel cells. NH4Cl is a cheap chemical which has mature synthesis technologies in large industrial productions. The protonic H (Hδ+) in NH4Cl and the hydridic H (Hδ−) in MgH2 have coulomb interaction which allow MgH2 to release hydrogen at milder temperatures. In this article, by designing the molar ratio of MgH2 and NH4Cl as 2:1 (equal molar ratio of Hδ+ and Hδ−), the hydrogen release peak temperature can be decreased to 164.8 °C, and the ammonia generation is remarkably suppressed. In particular, graphene introduction to the 2MgH2+NH4Cl composite can further reduce the hydrogen release temperature to 161.2 °C and improve the hydrogen purity up to 97.26%. It is revealed that the smaller particle size and the better dispersion of 2MgH2+NH4Cl/graphene composite allows better interaction between Hδ+ and Hδ−, which brings down the hydrogen desorption temperature and improves the hydrogen purity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  The increasing energy demand for next-generation portable and miniaturized electronics has drawn tremendous attention to develop microscale energy storage and conversion devices with light weight and flexible characteristics. Herein, we report the preparation of flower-like cobalt vanadium selenide/nickel copper selenide (CoVSe/NiCuSe) microspheres with three-dimensional hierarchical structure of micropore growth on copper wire for a flexible fiber microsupercapacitor (microSC) and overall water splitting. The CoV-LDH microspheres are anchored on the dendrite-like NiCu nanostructured Cu wire using a hydrothermal method (CoV-LDH/NiCu@CW). The sulfidation and selenization of CoV-LDH/NiCu was carried out through the ion-exchange reaction of OH− with sulfide and selenide ions to obtain CoVS/NiCuS@CW and CoVSe/NiCuSe@CW electrodes, respectively.

 Abstract:  The on-board hydrogen storage needs light, compact, and affordable system to replace the compressed hydrogen tanks. MgH2 is regarded as one of the most promising candidates for solid-state hydrogen storage. Due to the thermodynamically stable Mg-H bond, the poor dissociation ability of H2 molecules and recombination ability of H atoms on Mg surface, and the low diffusion coefficient of H atoms in Mg, especially in MgH2, there remains a challenge to design a material capable of absorbing and desorbing hydrogen rapidly at moderate temperatures. Herein, common strategies to improve the hydrogen storage properties of Mg-based materials are introduced. Some recent studies for overcoming the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers are reviewed, especially the approaches to fabricate nanostructure in Mg-based materials. The nanometric crystals or particles are synthesized by mechanical deformation, reduction in solution, physical/chemical vapor deposition, interface confinement. The nano-catalyst can be decorated by external doping or in-situ synthesis. In particular, the thermodynamic/kinetic parameters for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation are provided, and the mechanisms for the enhanced properties are summarized. The principles of structural design and catalytic decoration are discussed, and challenges and perspectives of fabricating nanostructures in Mg-based hydrogen storage materials are proposed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Understanding the alteration mechanisms of UO2-based nuclear fuel has a range of practical implications for both short- and long-term storage of spent fuel rods and environmental ramifications for the mobility of radioactive material at the Chernobyl and Fukushima sites. The major identified alteration phases on the surface of nuclear waste are analogues of schoepite UO3·2H2O, studtite UO2(O2)·4H2O, rutherfordine UO2CO3, and čejkaite Na4UO2(CO3)3. While α-radiolysis has been shown to cause the ingrowth of uranyl peroxide alteration phases, the prevalence of uranyl carbonate phases on solid waste forms has not been mechanistically explained to date, especially since the alteration chemistry is largely affected by the high temperatures of the spent nuclear material. Herein, we demonstrate the first mechanistic link between the formation of the uranyl superoxide (KUPS-1) phase, its reactivity at temperature ranges relevant to the spent nuclear fuel (40-350 °C), and its thermodynamic transformation into a potassium uranyl carbonate mineral phase, agricolaite K4[UO2(CO3)3], using thermogravimetric analysis, calorimetry, vibrational spectroscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction techniques. The thermodynamics data reveal the metastability of the uranyl superoxide KUPS-1 phase through decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide within the solid-state lattice. Increasing the temperature does not result in the breakdown of the superoxide anion bound to the uranyl cation but instead enhances its reactivity in the presence of CO2 gas, resulting in potassium carbonate phases at intermediate temperatures (150 °C) and in uranyl carbonate phases at higher temperatures (350 °C).  © 2022 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  A solid-state storage system is the most practical option for hydrogen because it is more convenient and safer. Metal hydrides, especially MgH2, are the most promising materials that offer high gravimetric capacity and good reversibility. However, the practical application of MgH2 is restricted by slow sorption kinetics and high stability of thermodynamic properties. Hydrogen storage performance of MgH2 was enhanced by introducing the Mg–Na–Al system that destabilises MgH2 with NaAlH4. The Mg–Na–Al system has superior performance compared to that of unary MgH2 and NaAlH4. To boost the performance of the Mg–Na–Al system, the ball milling method and the addition of a catalyst were introduced. The Mg–Na–Al system resulted in a low onset decomposition temperature, superior cyclability and enhanced kinetics performances. The Al12Mg17 and NaMgH3 that formed in situ during the dehydrogenation process modify the reaction pathway of the Mg–Na–Al system and alter the thermodynamic properties. In this paper, the overview of the recent progress in hydrogen storage of the Mg–Na–Al system is detailed. The remaining challenges and future development of Mg–Na–Al system are also discussed.

 Abstract:  Herein, real-time observations of dehydrogenation of a Mg2FeH6–MgH2 composite by means of in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with advanced spatial (≈0.8 Å) and temporal (25 frames s−1) resolution are reported. Careful control and systematic variations of the reaction temperature and electron dose rate enable detailed and direct visualization of the characteristic decomposition of Mg2FeH6 into Mg and Fe, which occurs on the nanometer scale under optimal experimental conditions defined to minimize the electron-beam-driven Mg oxidation and dehydrogenation that take place in TEM. First, the formation of nanostructured fine Fe clusters in Mg metal and their growth via coalescence during dehydrogenation are verified. Additionally, fine monitoring of the in situ diffraction patterns acquired during decomposition of the composite allows separate evaluations of the desorption kinetics of the two coexisting phases, which confirm the synergetic dehydrogenation of this dual-phase system. It is envisioned that these findings will provide useful guidelines for reducing the gaps between nanoscale and bulk-scale research and designing hydrogen sorption conditions to enable efficient operation of a solid-state hydrogen storage system. © 2022 The Authors.

 Abstract:  Safe, compact, lightweight and cost-effective hydrogen storage is one of the main challenges that need to be addressed to effectively deploy the hydrogen economy. LiAlH4, as a solid-state hydrogen storage material, presents several advantages such as high hydrogen storage capacity, low price and abundant sources. Unfortunately, neither thermodynamic nor kinetic properties of dehydrogenation for LiAlH4 can fulfill the requirements of practical application. Thus, a series of spinel ferrite nanoparticles such as XFe2O4 (X = Ni, Co, Mn, Cu, Zn, Fe) were prepared by using the modified thermal decomposition method, and then doped into LiAlH4 by using ball milling. Our results show that LiAlH4 doped with 7 wt% NiFe2O4 starts to release hydrogen at 69.1 °C, and the total amount of hydrogen released is 7.29 wt% before 300 °C. The activation energies of the two-step hydrogen release reactions of LiAlH4 doped with 7 wt% NiFe2O4 are 42.32 kJ mol−1 and 71.42 kJ mol−1, which are 59.0% and 63.6% lower than those of as-received LiAlH4, respectively. Combining the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we reveal that both the presence of NiFe2O4 and in-situ formed Al4Ni3 in ball-milling decrease the desorption energy barrier of Al-H bonding in LiAlH4 and accelerate the breakdown of Al-H bonding through the interfacial charge transfer and the dehybridization of the Al-H cluster. Thus, the experimental and theoretical results open a new avenue toward designing high effective catalysts applied to LiAlH4 as a candidate for hydrogen storage. © 2021

 Abstract:  PA56 is a newly commercialized bio-based polyamide with excellent thermal, mechanical and processing properties. However, its hydrogen bonds and crystalline structures are not well investigated yet. In this study, PA56 films with γ form and α-like form crystalline phases were successfully prepared by melt-crystallization and solution casting, respectively. The hydrogen bond and crystalline structure were systematically studied with solid-state 13C NMR, variable temperature-FTIR and dynamic oscillatory rheological tests. 13C NMR and variable temperature-FTIR results indicate that the hydrogen bond strength of PA56 in α-like form crystal is higher than that in γ-form, while both are lower than that of PA66 in α-form. The chemical shifts of carbons in diamine units are highly dependent on the crystalline forms due to the molecular chain of PA56 adopts different conformations in γ-form and α-like form. The curve-fitting of variable temperature-FTIR spectra reveals that the melt crystallization results in γ-form regardless of the crystal form before melt.

 Abstract:  Polyaniline/poly(vinyl alcohol)/TiO2 (PANI/PVA/TiO2) hybrid hydrogels with improved mechanical and electrochemical properties were fabricated via in situ oxidative polymerization of aniline (ANI) and in situ synthesized TiO2 with sol–gel method. Due to the combination of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions among PANI, PVA, and TiO2, this inorganic hybrid crosslinking structures enabled the PANI/PVA/TiO2 hybrid hydrogel to possess reinforced tensile/compressive strength (26.5 kPa/8.2 MPa) and unprecedented self-healing performance. Moreover, with the optimized conductive pathways in the hybrid hydrogel, its conductivity was up to 1.38 S/m, which meets the requirement of being utilized as high-performance flexible solid-state supercapacitors. At current density of 0.5 A/g, the hydrogel-based supercapacitor provided a large capacitance of 41.0–127.5 F/g and a high energy density of 0.9–2.8 Wh/kg, which were superior to other flexible supercapacitors.

 Abstract:  TiFe-based alloys are solid-state hydrogen storage materials operated at room temperature (RT). The current study presents a systematic approach for solving the activation issue (difficulty in the first hydrogenation), one of the major obstacles to the practical application of TiFe alloys, via the use of a secondary AB2 phase. Based on the Ti–Fe–Cr ternary phase diagram, Ti–Fe–Cr alloys containing 80 at% Ti(Fe,Cr) (AB phase) and 20 at% Ti(Fe,Cr)2 (AB2 phase) were designed; the Cr concentrations in the AB and AB2 phase were systematically varied while maintaining fixed phase fractions. Activation at RT was achieved when the overall Cr concentration was higher than 9.7 at%. Analysis of the activation characteristics of the individual phases revealed that the AB2 phase readily absorbed hydrogen, thereby initiating activation of AB + AB2 alloys. Notably, higher Cr concentrations enable the AB phase to absorb hydrogen at RT during the activation process, although the kinetics are much slower than that of the co-existing AB2 phase. The equilibrium hydrogen pressures from the pressure-composition isotherms decrease as the Cr concentration increases, indicating that Cr stabilizes hydrides. Increased hydride stability may also promote the kinetics of the initial hydride formation in both the AB and AB2 phases. An optimal composition for Ti–Fe–Cr alloys can be designed given the conditions of easy activation at RT and maximum reversible capacity within an operating pressure range. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  With global efforts to relieve the formidable impact of climate change, hydrogen is considered a viable replacement for fossil fuels without intermittency concerns of other renewable sources. Hydrogen storage plays a pivotal role in the implementation of hydrogen economy, coupling hydrogen production with fuel cell technologies. Storing hydrogen in the form of solid-state hydride materials has been studied as a future hydrogen storage technology for enabling a safe, energy-efficient, and high-energy-density system. However, hostile thermodynamic and kinetic properties of each hydride material result in insufficient hydrogen storage performance for practical applications, such as sluggish hydrogen absorption or desorption, high dehydrogenation temperatures, and sometimes limited reversibility; thus, these kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics need to be thoroughly understood depending on each hydride material. Among various strategies, nanostructuring has been regarded as a general approach to tackling such limitations regarding thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of hydride materials. In particular, the formation of nanosized hydrides within a nanostructured scaffold also known as nanoconfinement is of great potential for advanced hydrogen storage because it can additionally leverage host-guest interactions at the nanointerfaces of hydride materials and scaffolds. In this context, the active tuning of such nanointerfaces brings about additional thermodynamic or kinetic changes in hydrogen sorption reactions compared to the unmodified nanoconfined hydride composites, holding great promise for tailored strategies for each metal hydride. In this Perspective, we summarize the major thermodynamic and kinetic barriers of each metal hydride and highlight the recent progress in overcoming such limits, mainly focusing on nanointerface engineering in nanoconfined metal hydrides. Further, we provide our insight and current challenges in understanding the underlying mechanisms of the interaction at the nanointerface, whereby the noticeable technological leaps can be emulated in practical systems. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  A systematic investigation was performed on the 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 destabilized system with the inclusion of 5 wt% Al2TiO5 that was prepared by a ball milling process, and the hydrogen sorption performances were studied for the first time. A great advancement of the onset dehydrogenation temperature and de/rehydrogenation kinetics of 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 composite was achieved by doping Al2TiO5 to the composite. For the first and second desorption stages, the 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 + 5 wt% Al2TiO5 composite began to liberate hydrogen at 85 °C and 230 °C. In comparison, the undoped system commenced to liberate hydrogen at 120 °C and 270 °C, which were 35 °C and 10 °C lower, respectively when contrasted with the undoped composite. For the rehydrogenation kinetics, about 1.9 wt% hydrogen was absorbed within 5 min for the 5 wt% Al2TiO5-doped 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 system, whereas the neat sample only absorbed about 1.2 wt% hydrogen under similar conditions. As for the dehydrogenation kinetics, 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 + 5 wt% Al2TiO5 composite desorbed 1.7 wt% hydrogen within 10 min of desorption, while the 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 system released 0.8 wt% hydrogen in the same time frame. The apparent activation energy for the MgH2-relevant decomposition decreased from 121 kJ/mol (4MgH2 + LiAlH4 system) to 102 kJ/mol, after 5 wt% Al2TiO5 was introduced into the destabilized system. The decline in particle size also enhance the hydrogen storage behaviors. The synergistic effect of Al2TiO5 on the hydrogen storage behavior of 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 sample is attributed to the formation of new species of TiH2, AlTi2 and LiTi2O4 after ball milling and heating process, which acted as a real catalyser in the 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 + 5 wt% Al2TiO5 destabilized system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  The transport and storage of ions within solid state structures is a fundamental limitation for fabricate more advanced electrochemical energy storage, memristor, and electrochromic devices. Crystallographic shear structure can be induced in the tungsten bronze structures composed of corner-sharing WO6 octahedra by the addition of edge-sharing NbO6 octahedra, which might provide more storage sites and more convenient transport channels for external ions such as hydrogen ions and alkali metal ions. Here, we show that Nb2O5•15WO3 nanowires (Nb/W = 0.008) with long length-diameter ratio, smooth surface, and uniform diameter have been successfully synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. The Nb2O5•15WO3 nanowires do exhibit more advantages over h-WO3 nanowires in electrochemical hydrogen ion storage such as smaller polarization, larger capacity (71 mAh g-1, at 10C, 1C = 100 mA g-1), better cycle performance (remain at 99% of the initial capacity after 200 cycles at 100C) and faster H+ ions diffusion kinetics.

Catalytic hydrogenation by nanoscale heterogeneous catalysts with gaseous H2 or solid-state H2 has emerged as a promising approach, which relies on reducing BrO3− to innocuous Br− via the process of direct electron transfer or reduction with atomic hydrogen. Several nanocatalysts have demonstrated high efficiency with a 100% effective BrO3− reduction with greater than 95% of Br− generation in the batch and continuous reactors. However, this technology has not been widely adopted in water treatment systems. Indeed, this research article summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of these technologies by highlighting the factors of nanomaterials reduction efficiency, long-term durability, and stability, as well as addressing the essential challenges limiting the implementation of the use of H2 for BrO3− reduction. In this work, we provide an economic evaluation of catalytic BrO3− removal, safe hydrogen supply, storage, and transportation. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

 Abstract:  The development of new phase change materials that can store large amounts of renewable thermal energy will aid the decarbonisation of the energy sector that is crucial for future generations. For substantial development of these materials, understanding the relationships that underpin the enthalpy of fusion (ΔHf) is critical. In the present work, the role of hydrogen bonding in the energy storage mechanism is elucidated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and Hirshfeld surface analyses on a range of novel and known protic organic salts based on the guanidinium, acetamidinium, and formamidinium cations. Bonding motifs and strengths are probed through the steric and electronic properties of the anions, specifically with the use of the methanesulfonate ([CH3SO3]-), trifluoromethanesulfonate ([CF3SO3]-), para-toluenesulfonate ([C7H7SO3]-), trifluoroacetate ([CF3COO]-) and chloride (Cl-) anions. We consider entropic contributions to melting thermodynamics, and the results highlight the importance of strong hydrogen bonds in the solid state, finding an increased density of hydrogen bonds can be detrimental to ΔHf if the result is non-geometrically favoured or bifurcated interactions. The results propose a new rationale for the design of these systems through matching the number of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor sites. As well as increasing the linearity and strength of hydrogen bonds, such matching aids in the formation of predictable, energetically favourable supramolecular motifs, that contribute to ΔHfvia the energetic cost of their dislocation upon melting. These insights should inform the design of future high-performance phase change materials that can efficiently store sustainable energy, helping to overcome the intermittency issues typically associated with renewable energy systems.

 Abstract:  Organic electrode materials possess many advantages such as low toxicity, sustainability, and chemical/structural tunability toward high energy density. However, to compete with inorganic-based compounds, crucial aspects such as redox potential, capacity, cycling stability, and electronic conductivity need to be improved. Herein, a comprehensive strategy on the molecular design of small organic electron-acceptor-molecule—hexaazatrianthranylene (HATA) embedded quinone (HATAQ) is reported. By introducing conjugated quinone moieties into the electron-deficient hexaazatriphenylene-derivative core, HATAQ with highly extended π-conjugation can yield extra-high capacity for lithium storage, delivering a capacity of 426 mAh g−1 at 200 mA g−1 (0.4C). At an extremely high rate of 10 A g−1 (19C), a reversible capacity of 209 mAh g−1 corresponding to nearly 85% retention is obtained after 1000 cycles. A unique network of unconventional lock-and-key hydrogen bonds in the solid-state facilitates favorable supramolecular 2D layered arrangement, enhancing cycling stability. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the capacity and rate capability of HATAQ are found to be the best ever reported for organic small-molecule-based cathodes. These results together with density functional theory studies provide proof-of-concept that the design strategy is promising for the development of organic electrodes with exceptionally high energy density, rate capability, and cycling stability. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

 Abstract:  Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is a potential material for solid-state hydrogen storage. However, the thermodynamic and kinetic properties are far from practical application in the current stage. In this work, two-dimensional vanadium carbide (V2C) MXene with layer thickness of 50−100 nm was fist synthesized by selectively HF-etching the Al layers from V2AlC MAX phase and then introduced into MgH2 to improve the hydrogen sorption performances of MgH2. The onset hydrogen desorption temperature of MgH2 with V2C addition is significantly reduced from 318 °C for pure MgH2 to 190 °C, with a 128 °C reduction of the onset temperature. The MgH2 + 10 wt% V2C composite can release 6.4 wt% of H2 within 10 min at 300 °C and does not loss any capacity for up to 10 cycles. The activation energy for the hydrogen desorption reaction of MgH2 with V2C addition was calculated to be 112 kJ mol−1 H2 by Arrhenius's equation and 87.6 kJ mol−1 H2 by Kissinger's equation. The hydrogen desorption reaction enthalpy of MgH2 + 10 wt% V2C was estimated by van't Hoff equation to be 73.6 kJ mol−1 H2, which is slightly lower than that of the pure MgH2 (77.9 kJ mol−1 H2). Microstructure studies by XPS, TEM, and SEM showed that V2C acts as an efficient catalyst for the hydrogen desorption reaction of MgH2. The first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the bond length of Mg−H can be reduced from 1.71 Å for pure MgH2 to 2.14 Å for MgH2 with V2C addition, which contributes to the destabilization of MgH2. This work provides a method to significantly and simultaneously tailor the hydrogen sorption thermodynamics and kinetics of MgH2 by two-dimensional MXene materials. © 2021

 Abstract:  In recent years, many solid-state hydride-based materials have been considered as hydrogen storage systems for mobile and stationary applications. Due to a gravimetric hydrogen capacity of 5.6 wt% and a dehydrogenation enthalpy of 38.9 kJ/mol H2, Mg(NH2)2 + 2LiH is considered a potential hydrogen storage material for solid-state storage systems to be coupled with PEM fuel cell devices. One of the main challenges is the reduction of dehydrogenation temperature since this system requires high dehydrogenation temperatures (~ 200 °C). The addition of KH to this system significantly decreases the dehydrogenation onset temperature to 130 °C. On the one hand, the addition of KH stabilizes the hydrogen storage capacity. On the other hand, the capacity is reduced by 50% (from 4.1 to 2%) after the first 25 cycles. In this work, the particle sizes of the overall hydride matrix and the potassium-containing species are investigated during hydrogen cycling. Relation between particle size evolution of the additive and hydrogen storage kinetics is described by using an advanced synchrotron-based technique: Anomalous small-angle X-ray scattering, which was applied for the first time at the potassium K-edge for amide-hydride hydrogen storage systems. The outcomes from this investigation show that, the nanometric potassium-containing phases might be located at the reaction interfaces, limiting the particle coarsening. Average diameters of potassium-containing nanoparticles double after 25 cycles (from 10 to 20 nm). Therefore, reaction kinetics at subsequent cycles degrade. The deterioration of the reaction kinetics can be minimized by selecting lower absorption temperatures, which mitigates the particle size growth, resulting in two times faster reaction kinetics. © 2022, The Author(s).

 Abstract:  In the era of chaotic global warming and climate change, the hunt for alternative energy sources for fossil fuel has become an intense topic. The most viable clean, green and alternative energy carrier is hydrogen that can meet out the challenges posed towards energy scarcity. So, the present work focus on the effective storing of hydrogen on non-carboneous (Ah-BN) and hydrogen rich metal hydride (NaBH4) based storage medium. where a facile chemical impregnated method was adopted for the preparation of NaBH4/Ah-BN nanocomposite. The structural, morphological, elemental composition and specific surface area analysis of the prepared NaBH4/Ah-BN nanocomposite confirms the presence of NaBH4 wrapped around Ah-BN and enhanced specific surface area of 154.4 m2 g −1 (NaBH4/Ah-BN) from 68.2 m2 g −1 (Ah-BN). The presence of NaBH4 not only increases the specific surface area but also increases the pore volume thereby creating more defects. In contrast the presence of Ah-BN drastically reduces the decomposition temperature of NaBH4. The amount of stored hydrogen (Sievert's-like hydrogenation setup) was 3.8 wt% at 119 °C and the binding energy falls in the recommended range (0.33 −0.50 eV) of US-Department of Energy (DOE) 2025 targets. All the thermal analysis [thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)] ensures the two-step dehydrogenation for NaBH4/Ah-BN. Moreover, the utilization of NaBH4/Ah-BN as an electrode to store hydrogen electrochemically reveals the attainment of 2550 mAh/g discharge capacity during 15 cycles that equals to 4.10 wt% hydrogen storage capacity. Hence, these excellent characteristics proved that the prepared NaBH4/Ah-BN nanocomposite may serve as an excellent weakly chemisorbed hydrogen storage system and electrode material to store hydrogen electrochemically in the realm of Hydrogen Fuel cells. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are receiving significant attention as the next-generation electrolyte for battery applications, owing to their excellent safety aspects and potential load-bearing capability, as opposed to conventional organic electrolytes. Here, cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) was used as a new solid additive which can be replaced with most common organic or plastic crystals such as succinonitrile (SN) and polycarbonate (PC) to assist dissociation of lithium salts as well as to enhance an ionic conductivity in an epoxy-based poly (ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE) electrolyte. The PEGDGE-15 wt% bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt-30 wt% CHDM formulation (Li15-CHDM30), which enables the highest ion conductivities of 0.014 mS/cm and 0.2 mS/cm at 25 °C and 90 °C, respectively, with an increased Li+ transference number (tLi) of 0.71, was considered the optimized PEGDGE electrolyte system. This ionic conductivity at 90 °C is 13.6% and 61.7% higher than PEGDGE electrolyte systems containing 30 wt% SN (Li15-SN30) and 30 wt% PC (Li15-PC30), alongside 8.4% and 22.5% improvements in tLi values, respectively. It is proposed that the increase in ionic conductivity was facilitated by providing multidimensional channels at the cross-linking network interface between PEGDGE and CHDM as well as protonated groups in CHDM which attract more b is(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide anion (TFSI)− anions. Interestingly, increasing the CHDM content in the optimized PEGDGE electrolyte from 10 wt% to 30 wt% increased not only the elongation at break from 6.4% to 12.9% but also the tensile strength and toughness from 3.4 to 7 MPa and from 0.12 to 0.47 MJ/m3, respectively, which are significantly higher than those of values for Li15-SN30 and Li15-PC30 electrolyte systems. The high ductility and ionic conductivity of the Li15-CHDM30 are owing to physical bonding of CHDM via hydrogen bond and ion-dipole interactions with the resin matrix as evidenced by fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), Raman, and 7Li-NMR spectroscopic analyses. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

 Abstract:  Magnesium-based hydrogen storage materials are considered as one of the most promising candidates for solid state hydrogen storage due to their advantages of high hydrogen capacity, excellent reversibility and low cost. In this paper, Mg91.4Ni7Y1.6 and Mg92.8Ni2.4Y4.8 alloys were prepared by melting and ball milling. Their microstructures and phases were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope, and hydrogen absorbing and desorbing properties were tested by the high pressure gas adsorption apparatus and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In order to estimate the activation energy and growth mechanism of alloy hydride, the JMAK, Arrhenius and Kissinger methods were applied for calculation. The hydrogen absorption content of Mg92.8Ni2.4Y4.8 alloy reaches 3.84 wt.% within 5 min under 350 ℃, 3 MPa, and the maximum hydrogen capacity of the alloy is 4.89 wt.% in same condition. However, the hydrogen absorption of Mg91.4Ni7Y1.6 alloy reaches 5.78 wt.% within 5 min, and the maximum hydrogen absorption of the alloy is 6.44 wt.% at 350 ℃ and 3 MPa. The hydrogenation activation energy of Mg91.4Ni7Y1.6 alloy is 25.4 kJ/mol H2, and the enthalpy and entropy of hydrogen absorption are -60.6 kJ/mol H2 and 105.5 J/K/mol H2, separately. The alloy begins to dehydrogenate at 210 ℃, with the dehydrogenation activation energy of 87.7 kJ/mol H2.

 Abstract:  Aqueous zinc batteries have been regarded as a promising energy storage technology due to their high energy, high material abundance, low toxicity, and intrinsic safety. NASICON-type materials have been proposed as efficient cathodes for rechargeable batteries, yet they suffer from fast degradation and low Coulombic efficiency in aqueous batteries. Here we demonstrate that a rationally designed aqueous electrolyte containing a supporting Na salt and polymer additive can efficiently suppress the water activity through hydrogen bonding and facilitate the anion involvement in interfacial reactions, thus enabling the stable operation of sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) cathodes in aqueous zinc batteries. As exemplified by a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, the cell with zinc metal anode exhibits high cycling Coulombic efficiencies (around 99.9 % in average) with a steady output voltage and capacity retention for 300 cycles.

 Abstract:  It is estimated that all fossil fuels will be depleted by 2060 if we continue to use them at the present rate. Therefore, there is an unmet need for an alternative source of energy with high calorific value. In this regard, hydrogen is considered the best alternative renewable fuel that could be used in practical conditions. Accordingly, researchers are looking for an ideal hydrogen storage system under ambient conditions for feasible applications. In many respects, carbon-based sorbents have emerged as the best possible hydrogen storage media. These carbon-based sorbents are cost-effective, eco-friendly, and readily available. In this Review, the present status of carbon-based materials in promoting solid-state hydrogen storage technologies at the operating temperature and pressure was reported. Experimental studies have shown that some carbon-based materials such as mesoporous graphene and doped carbon nanotubes may have hydrogen storage uptake of 3–7 wt %, while some theoretical studies have predicted up to 13.79 wt % of hydrogen uptake at ambient conditions. Also, it was found that different methods used for carbon materials synthesis played a vital role in hydrogen storage performance.

 Abstract:  MgH2 is one of the most promising materials for solid-state hydrogen storage, but its slow kinetics and relatively high dehydrogenation temperature have yet to be overcome. We have theoretically investigated surface energy and surface H vacancy formation on various MgH2 surfaces, including all possible H vacancy configurations in the studied size of MgH2(110), (100), (101), and (001), up to (3 × 2), (2 × 3), (2 × 2) and (2 × 2) slabs respectively, based on density functional theory. Consequently, the hydrogen diffusion paths on the surfaces are also studied. The most unstable surface, MgH2(001), has the most drastic change in vacancy formation energy. The relative high barriers for vacancy H formation, especially on the most stable surface, MgH2(110), reflect the slow kinetics of H release. The introduction of vacancy into MgH2 surfaces often induces defect levels in the energy-gap region. In general, the release of surface H atoms exhibits a pronounced dependence on the surface stability and the concentration of surface H vacancy, in line with the remarkable effect of ball milling in experiments. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Dihydrogen ligation to metal centers results in a wide range of metal-hydrogen interactions. Compounds containing non-classical dihydrogen ligands in which the H–H contacts are significantly longer than the 0.74 Å distance found in solid H2 are classified as Kubas-like compounds, stretched dihydrogen ligands, or compressed dihydrides, depending on the H–H contact length. Compounds containing stretched dihydrogen and compressed dihydride ligands are somewhat rare. Developing a more complete understanding of the metal-hydrogen and hydrogen-hydrogen interactions in these species may provide insights into the mechanisms for the oxidative addition reaction and hydrogen storage. Here, we use diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements, paired with both molecular and solid-state density functional theory (DFT), to fully characterize the nature of the metal-hydrogen and hydrogen-hydrogen interactions in a previously reported compound, OsClH3(PPh3)3. In that report, the H–H distance was measured as 1.48(2) Å by single-crystal neutron diffraction and was described as a “stretched” dihydrogen. The INS-generated phonon density of states is well described by the DFT calculations, including those normal modes dominated by the vibrational motions of the three Os-ligated hydrogen atoms. The resulting calculated electron charge density landscape indicates that there is no remnant bonding character between the Os-ligated hydrogen atoms in the compound. Based on these findings, we update the understanding of the metal-hydrogen bonding in this complex and reclassify it as a compressed dihydride. As such, OsClH3(PPh3)3 represents a rare example of a non-classical compressed dihydride species. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  A general problem when designing functional nanomaterials for energy storage is the lack of control over the stability and reactivity of metastable phases. Using the high-capacity hydrogen storage candidate LiAlH4 as an exemplar, we demonstrate an alternative approach to the thermodynamic stabilization of metastable metal hydrides by coordination to nitrogen binding sites within the nanopores of N-doped CMK-3 carbon (NCMK-3). The resulting LiAlH4@NCMK-3 material releases H2 at temperatures as low as 126 °C with full decomposition below 240 °C, bypassing the usual Li3AlH6 intermediate observed in bulk. Moreover, >80% of LiAlH4 can be regenerated under 100 MPa H2, a feat previously thought to be impossible. Nitrogen sites are critical to these improvements, as no reversibility is observed with undoped CMK-3. Density functional theory predicts a drastically reduced Al-H bond dissociation energy and supports the observed change in the reaction pathway. The calculations also provide a rationale for the solid-state reversibility, which derives from the combined effects of nanoconfinement, Li adatom formation, and charge redistribution between the metal hydride and the host.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Organic-based cathode materials have attracted considerable attention for sustainable Na-ion batteries due to their great promise to overcome the issues arising from the insertion of large Na+ into the rigid structures of conventional transition-metal-containing inorganic electrodes. The structural flexibility as a result of weak intermolecular interactions and simple electron- and ion-storage mechanisms found in organic compounds ensure facile and reversible transport of Na ions. To address the general drawbacks of small-molecule organic electrodes such as material dissolution in commonly used organic electrolytes and poor electronic conductivity, we report the use of a nitrogen- and carbonyl-rich highly extended π-conjugated small molecule, hexaazatrianthranylene (HATA) embedded quinone (HATAQ), as a cathode for sodium-ion batteries. The unique hydrogen bonds between highly functionalized conjugated HATAQ molecules allow supramolecular graphite-like 2D layered arrangements in the solid state which help facilitate the structural stability during long-term cycling and promote charge transfer. The compound delivers a capacity as high as 460 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 and an excellent capacity retention of 99% (∼138 mA h g−1) after 5000 cycles at an extremely high rate of 60 A g−1.

Graphene-based materials can be exploited for hydrogen adsorption and storage owing to their wonderful properties i.e. a very large surface area, high conductivity, high mobility of charge carriers, great mechanical strength, etc. Pure graphene does not comply with the criteria for hydrogen storage as set out in the Department of Energy, United States of America. As a result, efforts are being made in this direction to modify graphene and meet the specific requirements. The hydrogen storage on graphene-based solid-state sensors may occur through either physisorption or chemisorption. Density Functional theory helps to estimate the capacity of defected and doped graphene materials for hydrogen adsorption before experimental investigation. Multilayer graphene influences the performance of gas sensing by intercalating metal and non-metal atoms via atomic bonding. It estimates the adsorption energy, charge density, Density of states, band gap values, and gravimetric density to determine the sensing ability of the material. The present review is focused on the several DFT studies made for investigating the hydrogen adsorption and storage properties in graphene-based materials. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  The development of controlled processes for continuous hydrogen generation from solid-state storage chemicals such as ammonia borane is central to integrating renewable hydrogen into a clean energy mix. However, to date, most reported platforms operate in batch mode, posing a challenge for controllable hydrogen release, catalyst reusability, and large-scale operation. To address these issues, we developed flow-Through wood-based catalytic microreactors, characterized by inherent natural oriented microchannels. The prepared structured catalysts utilize silver-promoted palladium nanoparticles supported on metal-organic framework (MOF)-coated wood microreactors as the active phase. Catalytic tests demonstrate their highly controllable hydrogen production in continuous mode, and by adjusting the ammonia borane flow and wood species, we reach stable productivities of up to 10.4 cmH23 min-1 cmcat-3. The modular design of the structured catalysts proves readily scalable. Our versatile approach is applicable for other metals and MOF combinations, thus comprising a sustainable and scalable platform for catalytic dehydrogenations and applications in the energy-water nexus.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  With the growing demands for large-scale energy storage, Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs) with distinct advantages, including resource abundance, low-cost, high-safety, and acceptable energy density, are considered as potential substitutes for Li-ion batteries. Although numerous efforts are devoted to design and develop high performance cathodes and aqueous electrolytes for ZIBs, many challenges, such as hydrogen evolution reaction, water evaporation, and liquid leakage, have greatly hindered the development of aqueous ZIBs. Developing “beyond aqueous” electrolytes can be able to avoid these issues due to the absence of water, which are beneficial for the achieving of highly efficient ZIBs. In this review, the recent development of the “beyond aqueous” electrolytes, including conventional organic electrolytes, ionic liquid, all-solid-state, quasi-solid-state electrolytes, and deep eutectic electrolytes are presented.

 Abstract:  Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is one of the most promising materials for solid state hydrogen storage, but overly stable thermodynamics and sluggish kinetics of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation hinders its application. In this study, Mg90Al10 was prepared by hydriding combustion synthesis (HCS), and then various Ti-based compounds (Ti, TiH2, TiO2 and TiF3) were introduced into Mg90Al10 by ball milling. Mg90Al10 + 10 wt% TiF3 displays the most excellent dehydrogenation property compared with those doped with other Ti-based compounds. For instance, due to the addition of 10 wt% TiF3, the peak dehydrogenation temperature and the apparent dehydrogenation activation energy of the composite are 86 °C and 77.1 kJ/mol lower than those of Mg90Al10 (364 °C and 155.95 kJ/mol). In addition, the catalytic effect of TiF3 on the hydrogen storage properties of Mg90Al10 has been investigated in detail. Except for the unreacted TiF3, Al3Ti and MgF2 can be found during the first dehydrogenation process and remain stable in the subsequent de/hydrogenation cycles, which can act as the active sites to accelerate the hydrogen dissociation and recombination. Therefore, the excellent hydrogen storage properties of Mg90Al10 + 10 wt% TiF3 can be attributed to the catalytic effect of TiF3, in-situ formed Al3Ti and MgF2. Our result is very significant to emphasize the practical application of the Mg-Al hydrogen storage alloys. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Aqueous rechargeable batteries (ARBs) have the advantages of low cost, high safety and sustainable environmental friendliness. However, the key challenge for ARBs is the narrow electrochemical stability window of the water, undoubtedly leading to the low output voltage, the underachieved capacity and a low energy density. Prussian blues and their analogues have attracted great research interest for energy storage due to the advantages of facile synthesis, versatile categories and tunable three dimensional frameworks. Herein a flexible integrated potassium cobalt hexacyano ferrates (Co-HCF) on carbon fiber clothes (CFCs) were designed through a feasible route combining the controllable electrochemical deposition and the efficient co-precipitation process. The Co-HCF@CFCs demonstrate an excellent sodium ion storage with a high reversible capacity of 91 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 55 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 in aqueous electrolytes. The long cycling stability at the high current demonstrate the excellent structure stability of the Co-HCF@CFCs.

 Abstract:  Growing human activity has led to a critical rise in global energy consumption; since the current main sources of energy production are still fossil fuels, this is an industry linked to the generation of harmful byproducts that contribute to environmental deterioration and climate change. One pivotal element with the potential to take over fossil fuels as a global energy vector is renewable hydrogen; but, for this to happen, reliable solutions must be developed for its carbon-free production. The objective of this study was to perform a comprehensive review on several hydrogen production technologies, mainly focusing on water splitting by green-electrolysis, integrated on hydrogen’s value chain. The review further deepened into three leading electrolysis methods, depending on the type of electrolyzer used—alkaline, proton-exchange membrane, and solid oxide—assessing their characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. Based on the conclusions of this study, further developments in applications like the efficient production of renewable hydrogen will require the consideration of other types of electrolysis (like microbial cells), other sets of materials such as in anion-exchange membrane water electrolysis, and even the use of artificial intelligence and neural networks to help design, plan, and control the operation of these new types of systems. © 2021 by the authors.

 Abstract:  The development of efficient and low-cost solid-state hydrogen storage materials remains a significant challenge. Carbonaceous-based nanostructures supported with metal catalysts have shown promising results toward hydrogen storage. Here, we report on a facile one-pot synthesis of a novel three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and expanded graphite (EG) nanocomposite (NC) decorated with Pd nanoparticles (NPs) as hydrogen storage media. The effects of the electrochemically active surface area and surface oxygen groups of the as-synthesized Pd/rGO-EG on electrochemical hydrogen uptake and release were investigated in detail. For comparison, five Pd/rGO-EG NCs with rGO/EG mass ratios of 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 were prepared. All the Pd/rGO-EG NCs exhibited a much higher hydrogen storage capacity than Pd/rGO and Pd/EG. Among them, Pd/rGO-EG(1:1) showed the highest hydrogen uptake and release (9850 mC cm-2 mg-1), which was over six- and twofold increase compared to Pd/rGO (1480 mC cm-2 mg-1) and Pd/EG (4290 mC cm-2 mg-1), respectively. The synergistic effects of the rGO-EG NC could be attributed to the formation of the 3D graphene-based structure, a minimal degree of sheet stacking, and homogeneous Pd NP dispersion. The formed Pd/rGO-EG NC possessed significant interfacial active sites, thereby greatly enhancing its performance for hydrogen uptake and release. The influence of the applied electrode potential on the formation of α-phase and β-phase nucleation in the as-synthesized materials was further investigated.

 Abstract:  Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is considered as a promising solid-state hydrogen storage material due to its high hydrogen storage mass density and environmental friendliness. However, its sluggish dehydrogenation kinetics are still the bottleneck that restricts practical applications. To address this challenge, very recent pioneering experiments found that MgH2/single-atom catalyst (MgH2/SAC) heterojunctions can be promising candidates for hydrogen storage. However, the reaction mechanism and design guideline were still not well understood. Herein, we design and analyze MgH2/SAC heterojunction systems including nine 3d transition metals, using spin-polarized density functional theory calculations with van der Waals corrections. We found that the energy barriers of MgH2 dehydrogenation are significantly reduced by 0.51-2.22 eV through the promotion effects of a heterojunction. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, these promotion effects were analyzed in depth based on the observation of hydrogen diffusion behaviors. To provide further insights, the electron localization function, charge density difference, hydrogen adsorption energy, system electronegativity, d-band center, and crystal orbital Hamilton population were comprehensively analyzed to understand the origin of the high performance of MgH2/SACs. In particular, we found that the system electronegativity of SACs can act as an effective descriptor that predicts the dehydrogenation energy barriers. Most importantly, this study provides important design guidelines of a brand-new type of MgH2/SAC material and a promising solution to the sluggish kinetics of MgH2 dehydrogenation in hydrogen storage. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Aqueous sodium-ion capacitors (ASICs) offer great promise for inexpensive and safe energy storage. However, their development is plagued by a kinetics imbalance at high rates between battery and capacitive electrodes and a narrow voltage window due to water electrolysis. Here a unique nanowire bundles anode is designed that simultaneously affords ultrahigh rate capability and manifests robust Na+ insertion to suppress hydrogen evolution, enabling an advanced ASIC. The NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP) is grown on thin titanium foil by elaborately utilizing the weak ionization chemistry of NaH2PO4 (NHP), where single-agent NHP not only partially etches titanium to release TiO2+, but also induces the interfacial phase-transformation of pre-deposited orthomorphic Na4Ti(PO4)2(OH)2 cubes to hexagonal NTP nanowires. This anode has hierarchical architectures to facilitate charge and mass transport, thus working stably at considerably high rates of 15–150 C with high capacities. The first 2.4 V flexible solid-state NTP-based ASIC is designed with high energy densities (5.8–12.8 mWh cm−3; 57.9–62.1 Wh kg−1; total mass loading up to 8.1 mg cm−2) comparable to NASICON-based devices using organic electrolytes, demonstrating outstanding stability of 10 000 cycles and no performance decay even after continuous bending at 180o.

 Abstract:  Body-centered cubic (BCC) alloys are considered as promising materials for hydrogen storage with high theoretical storage capacity (H/M ratio of 2). Nonetheless, they often suffer from sluggish kinetics of hydrogen absorption and high hydrogen desorption temperature. Carbon materials are efficient hydrogenation catalysts, however, their influence on the hydrogen storage properties of BCC alloy has not been comprehensively studied. Therefore, in this paper, composites obtained by milling of carbon catalysts (carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbon, carbon nanofibers, diamond powder, graphite, fullerene) and BCC alloy (Ti1.5V0.5) were extensively studied in the non-hydrogenated and hydrogenated state. The structure and microstructure of the obtained materials were studied by scanning and transmission electron microscopes, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy. XRD and Raman measurements showed that BCC alloy and carbon structures were in most cases intact after the composite synthesis. The hydrogenation/dehydrogenation studies showed that all of the used carbon catalysts significantly improve the hydrogenation kinetics, reduce the activation energy of the dehydrogenation process and decrease the dehydrogenation temperature (by nearly 100 K). The superior kinetic properties were measured for the composite with 5 wt % of fullerene that absorbs 3.3 wt % of hydrogen within 1 min at room temperature. © 2021 The Author(s)

 Abstract:  Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) with excellent solvating capacity toward lithium salts and easy processable feature is considered as the promising polymer electrolyte matrix for energy storage devices. However, the poor capacity and cycling performances of PEO-based batteries resulted from weak mechanical strength and electrochemical properties greatly limit its development. Herein, chiral polyurethane (HPU) with a unique helical configuration is integrated into PEO, and a well-defined microphase separation architecture is induced in the resulted PEO@HPU hybrid. Besides the decreased crystallinity of PEO, the well-organized ordered and disordered microphase structure provides a ""green channel""for Li+ transfer, contributing to a record lithium ion transference number of 0.43 for PEO-based dual-ion conductors. The mechanical strength and dimensional stability of PEO are significantly improved by the introduction of rigid helical segments and intermolecular hydrogen bondings. The electrochemical window and the ionic conductivity of the PEO@HPU hybrid are 5.0 V (vs Li+/Li) and 4.92 × 10-5 S cm-1 (60 °C), respectively. By synergism of the decreased crystallinity and microphase separation, the LiFePO4/Li cell assembled with the optimized PEO@HPU presents a high discharge capacity of 153 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C, and the capacity retention ratio is 83.6% after the 80th cycle with a Coulombic efficiency of approximately 99%. The growth of lithium dendrites is effectively inhibited, and the improved interfacial compatibility between PEO@HPU and the Li metal electrode also plays a crucial role.

 Abstract:  Hydrides of the AB2 Laves type alloys (A=Zr, Ti; B = transition metal – Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cr, V) have been extensively studied as materials for the storage of gaseous hydrogen. They contain up to 4 H atoms/formula unit AB2, thus achieving reversible H storage capacities in the range between 1.5 and 2.0 wt% H and offering high rates of hydrogen charge and discharge, thus making them suitable for designing efficient hydrogen stores operating at ambient conditions. In the present study, we performed an experimental study and modeling of the thermodynamics and the kinetics of interaction in the AB2-hydrogen system. The experimental data was collected by studying a model alloy with a composition Ti0.15Zr0.85La0.03Ni1.126Mn0.657V0.113Fe0.113. Hydrogen absorption and desorption were studied in a volumetric Sieverts type apparatus at isothermal conditions using a single-step change/discharge and stepwise methods. The results obtained from the model simulation show that the reaction follows the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) model, with the value of exponent n = 1–1.25 for absorption and 1 for desorption. This indicates that the rate-limiting hydrogen absorption and desorption steps are jointly governed by hydrogen diffusion and grain boundary nucleation of alpha-solid solution and beta-hydride.

 Abstract:  Resistive switching induced by ion migration is promising for applications such as random-access memory (ReRAM) and neuromorphic transistors.

Here, we report reversible resistive switching characteristics in rare-earth oxyhydrides (REHxO(3-x)/2) induced by field insertion/extraction of H-. The current-voltage measurements revealed that the resistive switching response, hysteresis, and switching voltage vary greatly with the H-/O2-ratio in the films. We fabricated a ReRAM device using Ti/YH1.3O0.85/MoOxstructure and confirmed the bipolar-type operation with the resistance switching ratio of 1 order of magnitude over 1000 cycles.

 Abstract:  Aqueous Zn metal batteries (AZBs) are considered as a promising candidate of existing lithium-ion batteries for grid-scale energy storage systems owing to their inherent safety, low cost, and natural abundance.

 Abstract:  Along with the developments of large-scale energy storage system, Zn–Ni battery has received much attention. However, the poor cycling life and shelf life of Zn–Ni battery strongly limit its practical application. Herein, a solid-state functionalized composite (FC) separator was developed through a simple strategy to steadily regulate the anode-electrolyte interface characteristics to comprehensively improve the performance of Zn–Ni battery. FC separator has interaction with anode to guide even Zn deposition during cycling. As a result, the battery assembled with FC separator achieves superb cycling life of 1435 h (848th cycle). In addition, under the function of the PAAK from FC separator, hydrogen evolution reaction can be mitigated. The water retention ability has also been improved to ensure good storage performance, in which the battery exhibits an open circuit voltage higher than 1.63 V after 618 h at a high temperature of 60 °C. Besides, the negative effect brought by oxygen from cathodes has been reduced. Consequently, the battery keeps a high discharge capacity without breakdown for more than 800 h floating charge at 60 °C.

 Abstract:  Ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) represents a promising energy-dense material for hydrogen storage and propulsion; however, its energy release mechanisms on oxidation by solid-state oxidizers are not well understood. In this study, through in situ time-of-flight mass spectrometry supported by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we investigate the fundamental reaction mechanisms involved in the energy release from solid-state AB with different chemical oxidizers. We show that the reaction of AB with oxidizers like KClO4 is mediated by [NH3BH2NH3]+[BH4]− (DADB) formation, resulting in its kinetic entrapment into low-energy BNHx clusters that are resistant to further oxidation, thus limiting complete energy extraction. In contrast, with an ammonium-based oxidizer such as NH4ClO4, the presence of NH4+ ions enables AB to follow an alternative reaction pathway forming [NH3BH2NH3]+[ClO4]− rather than DADB, thus inhibiting the formation of BNHx species and facilitating its complete oxidation. This alternative reaction route causes the AB/NH4ClO4 system to exhibit remarkably higher energy release rates over that of AB/KClO4 (∼27x) and the standard Al/NH4ClO4 propellant (∼7x). © 2021 American Chemical Society

 Abstract:  Hydrogen is ideal for producing carbon-free and clean-green energy with which to save the world from climate change. Proton exchange membrane fuel cells use to hydrogen to produce 100% clean energy, with water the only by-product. Apart from generating electricity, hydrogen plays a crucial role in hydrogen-powered vehicles. Unfortunately, the practical uses of hydrogen energy face many technical and safety barriers. Research into hydrogen generation and storage and reversibility transportation are still in its very early stages. Ammonia (NH3) has several attractive attributes, with a high gravimetric hydrogen density of 17.8 wt% and theoretical hydrogen conversion efficiency of 89.3%. Ammonia storage and transport are well-established technologies, making the decomposition of ammonia to hydrogen the safest and most carbon-free option for using hydrogen in various real-time applications. However, several key challenges must be addressed to ensure its feasibility. Current ammonia decomposition technologies require high temperatures, pressures and non-recyclable catalysts, and a sustainable decomposition mechanism is urgently needed.

 Abstract:  As a crucial link in the application of hydrogen for an alternative clean energy, light-weight solid-state hydrogen storage materials, such as metal hydrides and complex hydrides, attract ever-growing attention, and they have a great application potential due to their high hydrogen storage densities. Intensive research performed on modifications of the composition of the materials to improve their unfavorable kinetics, the thermodynamics, and reversibility, put forward higher requirements to the characterization methods to study in-depth mechanisms of the improved hydrogen absorption and desorption performance. Fortunately, due to the high scattering cross-section of hydrogen and deuterium, neutron scattering techniques, including neutron diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering, small-angle neutron scattering, and neutron total scattering technology, have become powerful tools for characterizing hydrogen storage mechanism of metal hydrides and complex hydrides.

 Abstract:  The new-generation flexible aqueous magnesium-ion hybrid supercapacitors (MHSCs), applied in flexible devices, need to process high ionic conductivity and great flexibility at low temperatures. Here we report an anti-freezing, high ionic conductivity polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogel electrolyte based on low-concentration Mg(ClO4)2 salt. Physical characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrated that Mg(ClO4)2 salt can effectively disrupt the original hydrogen-bond network among water molecules by the newly formed hydrogen bonds between solvent H2O molecules and solute ClO4-, thus leading to a superior anti-freezing property. A quasi-solid-state MHSC was assembled using PAAm hydrogel electrolyte containing 4M Mg(ClO4)2 salt, which delivers a great energy density of 59.6 Wh/kg and power density of 3.45 kW/kg at -20 °C.

 Abstract:  Mesoporous hexagonal boron nitride (p-BN) has received significant attention over the last decade as a promising candidate for water cleaning/pollutant removal and hydrogen storage applications. Here, high-resolution solid-state NMR spectroscopy and plane-wave density-functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to obtain an atomic-level description of p-BN. 1H-15N or 1H-14N heteronuclear (HETCOR) correlation experiments recorded with either conventional NMR at room temperature or dynamic nuclear polarization surface-enhanced spectroscopy (DNP-SENS) at ca. 100 K reveal NB2H, NBH2, NBH3+ species residing on the edges of BN sheets. Ultra-high field 35.2 T 11B NMR spectroscopy was used to resolve 11B NMR signals from BN3, BN2Ox(OH)1-x (x = 0-1), BNOx(OH)2-x (x = 0-2), BOx(OH)3-x (x = 0-3), and BOx(OH)4-x- (x = 0-4). Importantly, 2D 11B dipolar double-quantum-single-quantum homonuclear correlation spectra reveal that many pore/defect sites are composed of boron oxide/hydroxide clusters connected to the BN framework through BN2O units. 1D and 2D 11B{15N} HETCOR NMR experiments, in addition to plane-wave DFT calculations of nine different structural models, further confirm the assignment of all NMR signals. The detailed structure determination of the pore and edge/defect sites within p-BN should further enable the rational design and development of next-generation p-BN-based materials.

 Abstract:  The generation of sustainable energy has become a priority issue to properly maintain the sustainability of humankind. To meet the future global energy demands, the efficient generation of clean and renewable energy like hydrogen has become the need of the hour. Currently, hydrogen is being used either as a compressed gas in high-pressure tanks or in liquefied form in tanks. However, these storage technologies have safety issues, making the solid-state storage approach an attractive alternative option. In this context, the potential of light-weight high-performance solid-state materials like MXenes (a few-atoms-thick layers of transition metal carbides, nitrides, or carbonitrides) allow reversible hydrogen storage. The Ti2C MXene has shown a maximum hydrogen adsorption capacity up to 8.6 wt%, which is far higher than the gravimetric capacity of metal-based complex hydrides (~5.5 wt%) as set by U.S. DOE (2015). Hydrogen storage performance was also evaluated in other MXenes like Ti3C2, Cr2C, Ti2N, and their composites. Despite their great potential, the utility of MXenes in hydrogen storage applications has not been explored to its full extent.

 Abstract:  Solid-state hydrogen storage materials often operate via transient, multistep chemical reactions at complex interfaces that are difficult to capture. Here, we use direct ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at accelerated temperatures and hydrogen pressures to probe the hydrogenation chemistry of the candidate material MgB2 without a priori assumption of reaction pathways. Focusing on highly reactive (101̅0) edge planes where initial hydrogen attack is likely to occur, we track mechanistic steps toward the formation of hydrogen-saturated BH4- units and key chemical intermediates, involving H2 dissociation, generation of functionalities and molecular complexes containing BH2 and BH3 motifs, and B-B bond breaking. The genesis of higher-order boron clustering is also observed. Different charge states and chemical environments at the B-rich and Mg-rich edge planes are found to produce different chemical pathways and preferred speciation, with implications for overall hydrogenation kinetics. The reaction processes rely on B-H bond polarization and fluctuations between ionic and covalent character, which are critically enabled by the presence of Mg2+ cations in the nearby interphase region.

 Abstract:  The chemistry of metal borohydrides and their derivatives has expanded signficantly during the past decade involving new compositions, structures, and the diversity of associated properties. Here we provide an overview of interesting results mainly from the past few years, discussed relative to previously published results. A range of new synthesis strategies has been developed to obtain pure samples, which has allowed very detailed structural, physical, and chemical investigations. A short overview of mono- and dimetallic borohydrides is provided, including a description of the complete series of rare-earth metal borohydrides and the recently discovered ammonium metal borohydrides, where the latter has attracted interest due to an extreme hydrogen content. Metal borohydrides appear to be the most promising class of materials to achieve high cationic conductivity of divalent metals, and particularly derivatives of metal borohydrides with neutral molecules show promise as future electrolytes for new types of solid-state batteries. Furthermore, metal borohydrides display a wide range of other properties, including optical, magnetic, semi conduction and possibly superconducting properties, and are also used as a new approach for carbon capture and conversion.

 Abstract:  We explore the photochemistry of polymeric carbon nitride (C3N4), an archetypal organic photocatalyst, and derivatives of its structural monomer unit, heptazine (Hz). Through spectroscopic studies and computational analysis, we have observed that Hz derivatives can engage in non-innocent hydrogen bonding interactions with hydroxylic species. The photochemistry of these complexes is influenced by intermolecular nπ*/ππ* mixing of non-bonding orbitals of each component and the relative energy of intermolecular charge-transfer (CT) states. Coupling of the former to the latter appears to facilitate proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET), resulting in biradical products. We have also observed that Hz derivatives exhibit an extremely rare inverted singlet/triplet energy splitting (ΔEST). In violation of Hund's multiplicity rules, the lowest energy singlet (S1) is stabilized relative to the lowest triplet (T1) electronic excited state. Exploiting this unique inverted ΔESTcharacter has obvious implications for transformational discoveries in solid-state OLED lighting and photovoltaics. Harnessing this inverted ΔEST, paired with light-driven intermolecular PCET reactions, may enable molecular transformations relevant for applications ranging from solar energy storage to new classes of non-triplet photoredox catalysts for pharmaceutical development. To this end, we have explored the possibility of optically controlling the photochemistry of Hz derivatives using ultrafast pump-push-probe spectroscopy. In this case, the excited state branching ratios among locally excited states of the chromophore and the reactive intermolecular CT state can be manipulated with an appropriate secondary “push” excitation pulse. These results indicate that we can predictively redirect chemical reactivity with light in this system, which is an avidly sought achievement in the field of photochemistry. Looking forward, we anticipate future opportunities for controlling heptazine photochemistry, including manipulating PCET reactivity with a diverse array of substrates and optically delivering reducing equivalents with, for example, water as a partial source of electrons and protons. Furthermore, we wholly expect that, over the next decade, materials such as Hz derivatives, that exhibit inverted ΔESTcharacter, will spawn a significant new research effort in the field of thin-film optoelectronics, where controlling recombinationviatriplet excitonic states can play a critical role in determining device performance. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

 Abstract:  Creating ion-transport channels in the polymer hydrogel matrix is an efficient method to improve conductivity. However, the traditional approach of modifying the side chains of the polymer to improve the mobile ions still delivers low ionic conductivity. Herein, a conductive self-healable hydrogel electrolyte (PVA-GB) with a three-dimensional network is designed and prepared via mixing supramolecular gel guanosine (G)-boric acid (B) in the polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix. As a natural K+ ion channel, the GB hydrogel cross-links with PVA via a dynamic borate ester and hydrogen bonding. As a result, the PVA-GB hydrogel with an appropriate amount (112 mg) of G displays higher ionic conductivity (70 mS cm-1) than the original PVA hydrogel (10.3 mS cm-1). It also exhibits fast self-healing capability that repairs scars in less than 1 min without other stimulation. Furthermore, when the optimized PVA-GB hydrogel is used as the electrolyte for an active carbon-based all-solid-state supercapacitor device, it shows a high capacitance of 209.1 F g-1 and nearly 100% capacitance retention after three cycles of cutting and healing.

 Abstract:  Solid-state hydrogen storage materials that are optimized for specific use cases could be a crucial facilitator of the hydrogen economy transition. Yet, the discovery of novel hydriding materials has historically been a manual process driven by chemical intuition or experimental trial and error. Data-driven materials' discovery paradigms provide an alternative to traditional approaches, whereby machine/statistical learning (ML) models are used to efficiently screen materials for desired properties and significantly narrow the scope of expensive/time-consuming first-principles modeling and experimental validation. Here, we specifically focus on a relatively new class of hydrogen storage materials, high entropy alloy (HEA) hydrides, whose vast combinatorial composition space and local structural disorder necessitate a data-driven approach that does not rely on exact crystal structures to make property predictions. Our ML model quickly screens hydride stability within a large HEA space and permits down selection for laboratory validation based on not only targeted thermodynamic properties but also secondary criteria such as alloy phase stability and density. To experimentally verify our predictions, we performed targeted synthesis and characterization of several novel hydrides that demonstrate significant destabilization (70× increase in equilibrium pressure, 20 kJ/molH2 decrease in desorption enthalpy) relative to the benchmark HEA hydride, TiVZrNbHfHx. Ultimately, by providing a large composition space in which hydride thermodynamics can be continuously tuned over a wide range, this work will enable efficient material selection for various applications, especially in areas such as metal hydride-based hydrogen compressors, actuators, and heat pumps.  ©

 Abstract:  MgH2 has attracted intense interest as one of the most efficient solid-state materials to reversibly store hydrogen owing to its large gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen capacities of about 7.6 wt% and 110 g/L, respectively. However, the high thermodynamic stability of ca. 76 kJ/mol-H2, and slow kinetics of H2 de/absorption at temperatures ca. 300 °C, have challenged the broad applications of MgH2 in the field of energy storage. In an attempt to solve these challenges, this study presents the catalytic effects of adding black TiO2−x reduced by KH (denoted as K-TiO2−x) on the hydrogen storage performance of MgH2. As compared with pristine and ball-milled MgH2, the addition of 5 wt% of K-TiO2−x into MgH2 significantly improves the absorption/desorption behaviors. The doped system respectively absorbs 4.0, and 6.0 wt% H2 within the first 6 min, and after 180 min of charging at room temperature; the hydrogen can be reversibly released off starting from 194 °C which is ca. 96 °C lower than the additive-free ball-milled MgH2. The system can also produce ca. 6.5 wt% H2 upon cycling. Investigations into the improved performance and the structural patterns of MgH2 +K-TiO2−x reveal the presence of “K2Ti2O3” pseudo-complex of Ti2+ that is liberated in situ during the sorption process of MgH2; this pseudo-complex is believed to act as a catalyst by providing nucleation sites, oxygen vacancies, and hydrogen diffusion channels at its boundaries with Mg/MgH2 for the enhanced hydrogen sorption performance observed in the catalyzed MgH2 composite. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Transition metal catalysts are particularly effective in improving the reaction kinetics of light metal hydrides for reversible hydrogen storage. Herein, tetragonal ZrO2 hierarchical nanoparticles (nano-ZrO2) composed of primary particles of ∼4 nm in diameter are successfully synthesized by a facile one-pot solvothermal process. The unique hierarchical structure features homogeneous distributions of in situ formed multivalent Zr-based species, which allow superior catalytic activity for hydrogen storage in MgH2. The MgH2+10 wt% nano-ZrO2 starts releasing H2 at 163 °C after one activation, which is 107 °C lower than additive-free MgH2, and 50 °C lower than that of bulk ZrO2-doped MgH2. At 230 °C, 5.9 wt% of H is rapidly liberated within 20 min from the nano-ZrO2-containing MgH2. More importantly, the material shows superior hydrogenation kinetics compared with all reported catalyst-modified MgH2. The nano-ZrO2-containing Mg took up 4.0 wt% of H in only 12 s at 100 °C under 50 bar H2, 400 times faster than the bulk-ZrO2-modified sample.

 Abstract:  Clathrate hydrates are solid ice-like compounds that entrap the gas or liquid molecules into their cavities of hydrogen-bonded water molecules. As compared to commonly available sI and sII structures of clathrate hydrate, the sH-type is reported to possess more stability and gas uptake capacity. Despite copious implications of the sH-type hydrates of mixed gases in gas storage and separation, the phase equilibrium modeling to predict their formation condition is rarely available in the literature due to inaccurate estimation of the interactions between the guest components. In this view, we develop a novel methodology using the Wong-Sandler mixing rule extended for the three-parameter Patel-Teja equation of state, in association with the statistical thermodynamics based van der Waals and Platteeuw model to define the hydrate phase. This apart, the solubility of the help gases in water is estimated using the Patel-Teja model instead of the empirical correlations. It is observed that the proposed formulation is capable of predicting the experimental phase equilibrium data with a range of 1.389–2.812 %AARD for a variety of sH hydrates (i.e., neohexane, methylcyclopentane, isopentane, 2,2-dimethylpentane and a recently discovered first vapor phase heavy former tetrafluorocyclobutane) having methane, nitrogen or carbon dioxide as their co-guest. © 2021

Density functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed that the N-doping effect enhances the electronic conductivity of MXene and the MXene heterostructure with an N-doped carbon layer possesses an enlarged work function as compared with the pure MXene, which effectively prevents the electrochemical oxidation and enables stable operation at higher positive potential. For these reasons, NMXC exhibits a higher capacity and wider operating voltage window as compared with pure MXene, and better rate performance than melamine formaldehyde-derived N-doped carbon (NC). A dual crosslinked hybrid polymeric hydrogel/electrolyte (denoted as PAM-co-PAA/κ-CG/ZnSO4) was also designed, which was obtained by forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds between ionic κ-carrageenan (denoted as κ-CG) double helix chains and the covalent poly(acrylic amide-acrylic acid) (denoted as PAM-co-PAA) main matrix. The test results show that the PAM-co-PAA/κ-CG/ZnSO4 hydrogel/electrolyte possesses a higher ionic conductivity of 1.76 S m-1, higher stretchability of 626.0%, and satisfactory compressibility. In addition, the quasi-solid-state ZHSC based on the NMXC cathode and PAM-co-PAA/κ-CG/ZnSO4 hydrogel/electrolyte demonstrated a low self-discharge rate of 1.75 mV h-1, a high capacity with 96.4% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles along with high energy/power densities of 54.9 W h kg-1/3314.4 W kg-1.

 Abstract:  Stimuli-responsive organic materials with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics have become a research hot spot in recent years due to their promising applications in information storage, organic light-emitting semiconductors (OLEDs) and chemosensors. In this study, we employ the molecular design strategy of introducing multiple weak interactions (π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding) and twisted molecular structures into the same molecular system to synthesize a new stimuli-responsive solid-state fluorescence switching molecule, 2,7-bis(4-(1,2,2-triphenylvinyl)phenyl)-9H-fluoren-9-one (TFT), in which the fluorenone and tetraphenyl ethylene moieties are incorporated. By culturing the crystals under different crystallization conditions, three polymorphs of TFT, yellow crystals (Y-TFT), orange crystals (O-TFT) and red crystals (R-TFT), were obtained. All of the three crystals exhibit high luminous efficiency and stimuli-responsive fluorescence switching under the stimuli of temperature, pressure, or solvent vapor. X-Ray single crystal structures, characterization of photophysical properties, powder X-ray diffraction, and theoretical calculations provide in-depth understanding of their phase transition and luminescence behaviors. The different emissions of the three crystal polymorphs originate from the molecular pairs (dimers), molecular layers, and single molecules, respectively. This study presents molecular-level understanding of the relationship between the organic molecular packing characteristics and the resulting optical properties. The simple-preparation, high luminescence efficiency and manageable, reversible tricolor fluorescence switching give TFT the potential to be a ''smart'' multifunctional luminescence material. In addition, this work also presents a design strategy for smart organic fluorescence switching molecules. This journal is  © the Partner Organisations.

 Abstract:  Multicomponent vanadium-based alloys (MVAs), often considered as conventional coarse-grained alloys, have been extensively studied in past decades as important metal hydride electrodes and solid state hydrogen storage materials. A micron-scale microstructure composed of a V-based main phase and a TiNi-based secondary phase has been often used to explain the electrochemical performance of MVAs, where the micron-scale TiNi-based secondary phase with a three-dimensional network is considered as a catalyst for electrochemical reaction and/or a current collector. However, the atomic-scale microstructure of MVAs has been largely unknown to date. Here, using advanced aberration corrected electron microscopy, we have found micron-/nano-scale hierarchical structures in an as-cast MVA, V0.35Cr0.1Ti0.25Ni0.3. The micron-scale TiNi-phase contains VCr nanoprecipitates whereas the micron-scale VCr-phase contains TiNi nanoprecipitates and Ni-rich nanoclusters. In addition, we have found that the nanoprecipitates plays an essential role in the hydrogen storage, namely, TiNi nanoprecipitates with a diameter of approx. 30 nm absorb hydrogen faster than their VCr-matrix.

 Abstract:  Fossil fuels consumption is not expected to decrease significantly in the next decade, driving the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration upward. Tremendous efforts have been made in the field of carbon capture with the development of porous material adsorbents such as metal–organic frameworks. New thermal and electrochemical catalytic processes have also been established to reduce CO2 into valuable products such as formic acid, ethanol, or hydrocarbons. Combining the CO2 capture and transformation in a single process is a clever way to optimize the overall process. Complex hydrides such as borohydrides (MBH4, M = Na, Li,…) and alanates (MAlH4) are frequently used as reducing agents in chemistry. They are also known as potential solid-state hydrogen storage materials. The superior gravimetric hydride density confers to these materials appealing properties for CO2 reduction. This article summarizes the reactivity of complex hydrides, especially borohydrides, with CO2, as well as the recent development in this field.

 Abstract:  Energy storage and conversion via a hydrogen chain is a recognized vision of future energy systems based on renewables and, therefore, a key to bridging the technological gap toward a net-zero CO2 emission society. This paper reviews the hydrogen technological chain in the framework of renewables, including water electrolysis, hydrogen storage, and fuel cell technologies. Water electrolysis is an energy conversion technology that can be scalable in megawatts and operational in a dynamic mode to match the intermittent generation of renewable power. Material concerns include a robust diaphragm for alkaline cells, catalysts and construction materials for proton exchange membrane (PEM) cells, and validation of the long-term durability for solid oxide cells. Hydrogen storage via compressed gas up to 70 MPa is optional for automobile applications. Fuel cells favor hydrogen fuel because of its superfast electrode kinetics. PEM fuel cells and solid oxide fuel cells are dominating technologies for automobile and stationary applications, respectively. Both technologies are at the threshold of their commercial markets with verified technical readiness and environmental merits; however, they still face restraints such as unavailable hydrogen fueling infrastructure, long-term durability, and costs to compete with the analog power technologies already on the market. © 2022, University of Science and Technology Beijing.

 Abstract:  Highly fine, dispersive, and active catalysts are essential for lowering the operating temperature of MgH2, a promising high-capacity material for solid-state hydrogen storage. In this work, ultrafine Ni nanoparticles (2-6 nm) are synthesized from the precursor nickel acetylacetonate (C10H14NiO4) on the surface of MgH2by H2plasma reduction process, followed by further ball milling. The obtained composite could rapidly release more than 6.5 wt % H within 10 min at 275 °C. Even at a low temperature of 225 °C, up to 6 wt % H could be desorbed. The MgH2-Ni composite also exhibits excellent low-temperature hydrogenation kinetics and almost no capacity degradation over nine hydrogenation/dehydrogenation cycles. The significant improvement in the hydrogen-storage properties is attributed to the in situ formation of ultrafine and stable Mg2NiH0.3nanocrystals during cycling.

 Abstract:  LaFeO3 as a new negative electrode material for nickel-hydrogen batteries used as energy storage has the advantages of high capacity, advanced temperature resistance, and low cost. However, its conductivity and dynamic performance are poor, seriously hindering its applications. In light of increasing concentration of oxygen vacancies and improving conductivity after replacing A-site elements of the material, here we synthesize low-priced Na doping LaFeO3 oxides, La1-xNaxFeO3 (x = 0-0.8), as the negative electrode by a solid-state reaction method. Studies show that doping Na can reduce particle aggregation, thus helping to increase the surface area of LaFeO3. Therefore, its discharge capacity remarkably increases to 356.7 mAh g-1 (x = 0.6) from 178.8 mAh g-1 (x = 0) at 60 °C, which also maintains 73.4% after 100 cycles for La0.4Na0.6FeO3, elevated by 55.1% compared to LaFeO3. In addition, the high rate discharge ability of an La0.4Na0.6FeO3 electrode at a discharge current density of 1500 mA g-1 reaches 30.7% in contrast to 11.2% for undoped LaFeO3. As such, the La0.4Na0.6FeO3 material with superior cycling capacity is proven to be a more promising electrochemical hydrogen storage electrode compared to LaFeO3, which greatly increases the practical application value of the material.  © 2021 The Electrochemical Society (""ECS"").

 Abstract:  A crosslinkable UIO-66 type MOF material denoted UIO-66-DETA composed of Zr(iv) metal ions and 2,5-diallyl ether terephthalic acid (DETA) was synthesized, and then by initiating double bond crosslinking, a new crosslinking MOF material denoted UIO-66-DETA-CL was obtained. UIO-66-DETA and UIO-66-DETA-CL were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, PXRD, 1H solid-state NMR spectroscopy, SEM, nitrogen sorption, thermogravimetric analysis and hydrogen storage tests to analyze their structure and properties. The results showed that a crosslinked structure has been formed, and UIO-66-DETA-CL can maintain its structure below 340 °C, compared with UIO-66-DETA; its carbon residual rate is improved, which shows that the crosslinking modification enhances the thermal stability. Meanwhile, the hydrogen uptake capacity of UIO-66-DETA-CL reaches 5.36 wt% at 77 K and 4 MPa. Furthermore, the hydrogen adsorption enthalpy of UIO-66-DETA-CL (ΔHUIO-66-DETA-CL) calculated using the Arrhenius equation reaches -0.889 kJ mol-1, which is significantly improved by crosslinking modification. The crosslinked structure changes the pore size and increases the active adsorption sites in organic ligands. The framework of UIO-66-DETA-CL can provide more polar charges to cause some hydrogen molecules to be negatively charged because of a small HOMO-LUMO gap, and a lower LUMO energy level of UIO-66-DETA-CL enables stronger negative charge acceptability. Therefore, crosslinking modification enhances the material's hydrogen storage capacity. This result provides a new idea for the crosslinking modification of MOFs.

 Abstract:  Effective storage and transfer of fluid commodities such as oxygen, hydrogen, natural gas, nitrogen, argon, and others is a necessity in many industries and for hosts of different applications. Molecules are typically contained as low pressure, cryogenic liquids; or as high-pressure gases. Liquefied gasses afford high energy and volume densities, but require complex storage systems to limit boil-off losses, need constant settling in zero-gravity, and are not well suited for overly dynamic situations where the tank orientation can change suddenly. Most cryogenic liquid tanks are complex, nested configurations to increase thermal performance, making them large, massive, and difficult to be made into conformal shapes. Conversely, high pressure gas storage bottles are unaffected by orientation, and can be kept at room temperature; however, these vessels are heavy-walled to contain the high pressures, and the energy densities associated with gas storage are dramatically lower. These two options are typically traded depending on the system requirements, but few practical options exist that provide the benefits while limiting the downfalls. Alternatively, the Cryogenic Flux Capacitor (CFC) technology employs nano-porous aerogel composites to store, by physisorption processes, large quantities of fluid molecules in a molecular solid-state condition, at moderate pressures and cryogenic temperatures. By virtue of its design architecture, a CFC device can be ""charged"" and ""discharged"" quickly and on-demand according to operational requirements. Three CFC application areas are introduced: CFC-Fuel, CFC-Cool, and CFC-Life, corresponding to designs utilizing fuels such as hydrogen and methane; inert fluids such as nitrogen and argon for cooling power; and oxygen or breathing air for life support. Data for physisorption within different aerogel composites are presented in terms of both mass and volumetric parameters. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

 Abstract:  Magnesium hydride (MgH2) has been considered as a potential material for storing hydrogen, but its practical application is still hindered by the kinetic and thermodynamic obstacles. Herein, Mn-based catalysts (MnCl2 and Mn) are adopted and doped into MgH2 to improve its hydrogen storage performance. The onset dehydrogenation temperatures of MnCl2 and submicron-Mn-doped MgH2 are reduced to 225 °C and 183 °C, while the un-doped MgH2 starts to release hydrogen at 315 °C. Further study reveals that 10 wt% of Mn is the better doping amount and the MgH2 + 10 wt% submicron-Mn composite can quickly release 6.6 wt% hydrogen in 8 min at 300 °C. For hydrogenation, the completely dehydrogenated composite starts to absorb hydrogen even at room temperature and almost 3.0 wt% H2 can be rehydrogenated in 30 min under 3 MPa hydrogen at 100 °C. Additionally, the activation energy of hydrogenation reaction for the modified MgH2 composite significantly decreases to 17.3 ± 0.4 kJ/mol, which is much lower than that of the primitive MgH2. Furthermore, the submicron-Mn-doped sample presents favorable cycling stability in 20 cycles, providing a good reference for designing and constructing efficient solid-state hydrogen storage systems for future application. © 2020 by the authors.

 Abstract:  Recently, transition metal oxides have been evidenced to be superior catalysts for improving the hydrogen desorption/absorption performance of MgH2. In this paper, Mn3O4 nanoparticles with a uniform size of around 10 nm were synthesized by a facile chemical method and then introduced to modify the hydrogen storage properties of MgH2. With the addition of 10 wt% Mn3O4 nanoparticles, the MgH2-Mn3O4 composite started to release hydrogen at 200 °C and approximately 6.8 wt% H2 could be released within 8 min at 300 °C. For absorption, the completely dehydrogenated sample took up 5.0 wt% H2 within 10 min under 3 MPa hydrogen even at 100 °C. Compared with pristine MgH2, the activation energy value of absorption for the MgH2 + 10 wt% Mn3O4 composite decreased from 72.5 ± 2.7 to 34.4 ± 0.9 kJ mol-1. The catalytic mechanism of Mn3O4 was also explored and discussed with solid evidence from X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) studies. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the Mg-H bonds were elongated and weakened with the doping of Mn3O4. In addition, a cycling test showed that the hydrogen storage capacity and reaction kinetics of MgH2-Mn3O4 could be favourably preserved in 20 cycles, indicative of promising applications as a solid-state hydrogen storage material in a future hydrogen society.

 Abstract:  With advantages of high hydrogen capacity, excellent reversibility, and low cost, magnesium hydride (MgH2) has been considered as one of the most promising candidates for solid-state hydrogen storage. However, the practical use of MgH2 as a hydrogen storage medium still needs to overcome great barriers both in the thermodynamics and kinetics. In this respect, nanotechnology plays an important role. Employing appropriate nanocatalysts for the hydrogen sorption and/or reducing the particle size of MgH2 to nanoscale have been demonstrated to be effective strategies.

 Abstract:  T-carbon had been proposed as a new carbon allotrope in 2011, which was successfully synthesized in recent experiments. Because of its fluffy structure, several kinds of atoms can be intercalated into T-carbon, making it a potential versatile candidate in various applications such as hydrogen storage, solar cells, lithium ion batteries, thermoelectrics, photocatalyst, etc. Here we show that superconductivity can appear in Na-doped T-carbon with a superconducting transition temperature Tc of 11 K at ambient pressure, and Tc can be enhanced to 19 K under a pressure of 14 GPa.

 Abstract:  As the world is shifting toward an increased reliance on renewable energy, the need for effective and robust energy carriers is more than pressing. In this context, hydrogen has a key role to play. However, the storage of hydrogen in a cost-effective, safe, and compact manner is a bottleneck to the future hydrogen economy primarily due to the lack of incentives and technical difficulties in storing hydrogen. So far, materials capable of ambient hydrogen uptake/release have a low storage capacity while high-capacity hydrides that may offer more compact alternatives still rely on very high hydrogen release temperatures.

 Abstract:  Deep geological repositories for radioactive waste contain metallic materials, either used to construct disposal canisters or as low-/intermediate-level waste (L/ILW). The safety relevance of corrosion is linked to canister lifetime in the former case and gas generation in the latter. More specifically, the Belgian “supercontainer” concept envisages mild steel for the used fuel disposal canister, and in the case of the Swiss L/ILW repository, mild steels are the largest metallic waste component due to the decommissioning of civilian power-generating facilities. For these circumstances, the corrosion environment is dominated by the chemistry of cement, which is used as buffer or backfill material. The corrosion behaviour of mild steel in anoxic environments was studied through the analysis of the hydrogen end-product. Hydrogen analysis was conducted by periodically purging the cell head-space and analysing the gas using a solid-state hydrogen sensor. While this method is limited to providing only uniform corrosion rates averaged over periods of time, ranging from weeks to months, it provides excellent resolution and sensitivity. The test cell environments were matched against the anticipated Belgian high-level waste and Swiss L/ILW repository environments, and also against experiments that have been conducted by other researchers for comparative purposes. Samples were exposed to synthetic cement pore waters, representing fresh and degraded cement. In young cement waters, the formation of initial corrosion products resulted in steel wire corrosion rates of the order of µm/year, which, at 80°C rapidly declined to ∼10 nm/year. In contrast, SA516 grade 70 steel plate corroded much more slowly under similar conditions. In aged cement waters, initial corrosion rates were higher but declined faster towards a longer-term rate of ∼10 nm/year. 316L stainless steel, embedded in cementitious material, corroded at a rate of <1 nm/year at 50°C. © 2020 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada Materials and Corrosion © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH Reproduced with the permission of the Minister of Natural Resources Canada

 Abstract:  Herein, we demonstrate a facile, template free, scalable, solid-solid, single step synthesis approach to produce ZnO/ZnS nanoheterostructure. Commercially available ZnO and thiourea have been used as precursors. Interestingly, it is observed that ZnO particle is covered with ZnS and the ZnS shell thickness can be varied depending on the sulfidation time. The crystal structures, morphology of samples are verified by XRD, FETEM and EDX. The XRD results show the mixed phases of hexagonal ZnO and ZnS. The broad peak of ZnS clearly reveals the nanocrystalline nature and also increase in intensity of peak with respect to sulfidation time. The optical spectra of the samples exhibits two band absorption edges and blue shift in the absorption edge depending on the ZnS thickness deposited. Particle size of the ZnS (5–3 nm) coated on the ZnO by varying the sulfidation time influences the performance of the DSSC and photocatalytic H2 evolution from water has been investigated, systematically. The DSSC performance of ZnO/ZnS nanoheterostructure shows maximum efficiency of 3.30% with increment in Jsc (9.04 mA/cm2). The performance is much better than pristine ZnO and earlier report of ZnO-ZnS nanostructure. This good performance is due to excellent light absorbing capability of the ZnO/ZnS nano heterostructure by providing ZnO core by providing easy electron transfer at the interface and the ZnS shell facilitate to reduce the recombination of diffuse electrons with either the dye or the electrolyte. The H2 evolution rate reported herewith is 3209 and 1685 μmol h−1g−1 under UV and Natural sunlight, respectively which is significantly higher than pristine ZnS and ZnO. The H2 evolution rate increases with decrease in particle size of ZnS which is quite ovibius because lowering particle size exhibits increase in surface area. The fabrication of ZnO/ZnS nanoheterostructure is the simple and cost effective, which can open new avenues strategy for large scale applications of the novel materials in the energy storage and photovoltaic devices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), because of their ordered pores and crystalline structure, become designable polymers for charge storage applications. Supercapacitors are critical in developing hybrid energy devices. Amalgamating these high-surface-area frameworks in the capacitor assembly can aid develop robust solid-state supercapacitors. Here, we present supercapacitors drawn on three closely related pyridyl-hydroxyl functionalized COFs. The keto-enol tautomerism and the hydrogen bonding ability of the hydroxyl units promise added chemical stability in this potentially hydrolyzable Schiff-bonded COF. Meanwhile, the pyridyl and triazine groups ensure rapid charge storage by reversibly interacting with protons from the acidic electrolyte. The COF with the highest surface area, as expected, yields an excellent specific capacitance of 546 F/g at 500 mA/g in acidic solution and ∼92 mF/cm2 at 0.5 mA/cm2 in the solid-state device, which is the highest among all the COF-derived solid-state capacitors, which is reflected by a high power density of 98 μW/cm2 at 0.5 mA/cm2, most of which is retained even after 10 000 cycles. This high activity comes from a smooth electrical-double-layer-capacitance favored by an ordered-porous structure and some pseudo-capacitance assisted by the participation of redox-active functional groups. The study highlights the by-design development of COFs for superior energy/charge devices.  Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  The growing demand for rechargeable batteries with high energy density has triggered research on batteries based on polyvalent cations such as Ca2+, Mg2+, Al3+, and Y3+. Ca is, in particular, a promising anode material as an alternative to Li because of its mechanical strength (ρ=1.55 g cm−3), safety in terms of thermal runaway (m.p.=839 °C), earth-abundance (world production of 150 million tons of gypsum in 2012), high specific charge capacity (1.340 mAh g−1 or 2.077 mAh cm−3), and standard reduction potential (−2.87 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode, NHE) comparable to that of Li. As with Mg, the practical application of Ca in rechargeable batteries with organic liquid electrolytes has been hindered by the passivation layer resulting from undesirable reactions between metallic Ca and electrolytes, which precludes the possibility of reversible plating of any metal cations on Ca electrodes. Here, a battery system based on intermetallic CaLi2 anodes was developed. Li was used as a host for Ca through the formation of an intermetallic compound, which simultaneously enabled 1) the assembly of a rechargeable battery system with Ca anodes and liquid organic electrolytes and 2) coupling these with an earth-abundant, high-energy-density air cathode without special passivation agents. This strategy is simple and broadly applicable to the other polyvalent cations listed above, opening a new avenue to further engineer the electrode materials required for practical, efficient electrochemical energy-storage systems. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

 Abstract:  A polymeric hydrogen carrier with reversible H2 storage capability was developed by incorporating a quinoxaline/tetrahydroquinoxaline redox couple into an aliphatic polymer chain. The quinoxaline unit was designed with a view to significantly increase the mass H2 storage density in the polymer up to 2.6 wt % calculated for the repeating unit, compared with the previously reported density of 0.9 wt % for poly(vinylfluorenone). An iridium complex-catalyzed hydrogenation of quinoxaline was characterized by its reversibility according to temperature, giving rise to tetrahydroquinoxaline under mild conditions (60 °C and 1 atm of H2), which released H2 gas by simply warming in common organic solvents. Its polymer extension allowed quinoxaline to be a polymeric hydrogen carrier in a solid state, which was characterized by the inherent advantages of safety, moldability, and handling easiness. Poly(vinylquinoxaline) was prepared by the radical polymerization of vinylquinoxaline.

 Abstract:  Non-catalytic dehydrogenation of solid-state ammonia borane (AB) and sodium borohydride (SB) mixtures is achieved in this work by water vapor facilitated hydrothermolysis with a maximum release rate of 560 ml g−1s−1at 53.5 °C and dehydrogenation capacity between 7.8 wt% (measured) and 11.7 wt% (theoretical). A novel dehydrogenation pathway is identified, in which intermolecular interaction causes the formation of intermediates and further enables the prevalence of homopolar dehydrocoupling between -BH moieties in AB and SB. The low-temperature heat used in hydrothermolysis enhances the intermolecular interaction, and the oxygen and hydrogen supplied by water vapor promote the dehydrogenation by forming products. This new hydrogen liberation method can uniquely operate without any catalyst, liquid solvent, or high temperature, and provides a compelling solution for disposable hydrogen source application. The present work also unveils for the first time the unique hydride-hydride homopolar dehydrogenation mechanism, which may unlock the true potential of chemical hydride based hydrogen storage systems. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.

 Abstract:  Protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) are promising solid-state energy conversion devices which enable the conversion of energy between electricity and hydrogen at intermediate temperatures. Rapid conversion between chemical and electrical energy via PCEC technology will assist in overcoming grand challenges in energy storage.

 Abstract:  In the present era the demand for fossil fuels is increasing at an alarming rate and to meet the need of time, it is required to switch to renewable sources for our energy needs. Hydrogen is reportedly considered as a future fuel as it can store three times more energy as compared to conventional fuel and emit zero emission [1]. However, it's safe and efficient storage is quite a challenge. Out of the three modes of storage, solid storage of hydrogen is proved to be the safest [2].

"Seperate the questions with commasTitle:Functionalized graphene materials for hydrogen storage
 Abstract:  With growing demands of energy and enormous consumption of fossil fuels, the world is in dire need of a clean and renewable source of energy. Hydrogen (H2) is the best alternative, owing to its high calorific value (144 MJ/kg) and exceptional mass-energy density. Being an energy carrier rather than an energy source, it has an edge over other alternate sources of energy like solar energy, wind energy, and tidal energy, which require a constant energy source dependent upon weather conditions. However, its utilization as an energy carrier has not yet been commercialized due to its poor storage performance, which is attributed to low gravimetric and volumetric densities of adsorbed hydrogen at ambient temperature and technological limitations in meeting the stringent parameters set by Department of Energy, USA. With exceptionally large surface area (2630 m2/g), porous nature, lightweight, and high chemical and thermal stability (melting point ~ 4510 K) along with the possibility of economical and scalable production, graphene-based solid-state porous materials have shown promising applications in efficient hydrogen storage. In this context, the present review discusses the recent advances and progress on the utilization of functionalized graphene, graphene oxide, and its derivatives for effective storage of hydrogen, along with important theoretical advancements via DFT calculations, first-principle calculations, and Monte Carlo Simulations, etc. Pristine graphene has poor hydrogen storage characteristics, and addition of dopants like boron and nitrogen or decoration by transition metals significantly improves the performance. In addition, graphene allows the tuning of surface curvature which can help in achieving a reversible hydrogen storage system with fast kinetics. The impact of external stimuli like electric field and strain on electronic structure of graphene is discussed with the applicability in achieving a highly controllable adsorption–desorption system. Finally, the review concludes with life cycle assessment of graphene-engineered composites for effective hydrogen storage applications, along with their energy and environmental implications. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

 Abstract:  BACKGROUND: Hydrogen has advantages that can be used as energy, but research on safe use is needed. OBJECTIVE: In this study, an actuation system for rehabilitation is developed to drive the actuator using hydrogen storage alloy and to analyze the hydrogen release characteristics of the alloy. METHODS: The system is automatically control and report the pressure, temperature and hydrogen flow using LabVIEW-based modules and LabVIEW software. Zr0.9Ti0.1Cr0.6Fe1.4 alloy was selected as hydrogen storage alloy. 5 MPa of hydrogen pressure was applied at 8.56 g of alloy powder for activation process and the temperature outside was maintained at 19°C to 21°C. The amount of hydrogen absorption was measured about 1.47 wt%. The actuation test was conducted at the temperature from 25°C to 80°C, increased by every 5°C. The actuation height was measured at each load of 5, 10, 15, and 20 kg. The voltage and current which is applied to peltier elements were set to 5.0 V and 2.5 A. The pressure changing in the system was checked for 5 min for each temperature, however, if the temperature at which the pressure inside the system changed, the time to heat the module was increased to 20 min. Hydrogen was first released at 70°C. RESULTS: The loads of 5 and 10 kg were raised by 87 and 19 mm at 70°C, respectively. At 75°C, loads of 5, 10 and 15 kg were raised by 131, 70, and 15 mm, respectively. At 80°C, 5, 10, 15, and 20 kg were raised by 150, the end of the actuator, 83, 55, and 28 mm, respectively.

 Abstract:  Molecular Dynamics simulations were employed to locate the densities and pressures at which infinitely spanning networks form for both physically and hydrogen bonded water clusters along the 650, 700, 750 and 800 K supercritical isotherms. The SPC/E water model was used and the percolation thresholds were determined by examining the cluster size distributions. Average hydrogen bond numbers for the entire system are reported and are near the critical number of 1.55 expected at the hydrogen bonded percolation threshold. Percolating physical clusters appeared at lower densities than infinite hydrogen bonded networks. Physical and hydrogen bonded percolation thresholds were plotted on the P-ρ and P-T planes. Neither of the lines of percolation transitions match the extension of the vapor-liquid coexistence line into the supercritical region. Empirical relationships were obtained for each transition threshold as functions of temperature as well as density. Activation volumes of diffusion increase rapidly until they reach their maximum at the threshold densities where water molecules are connected via percolating network of hydrogen bonds. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  As important as the production of CO2-free energy is, so is the motivation to develop efficient storage of renewable energies for mobile and stationary applications. There is no doubt that metal hydrides continue to attract the overall materials science community, and it is not only restrained to a specialized hydrogen field. This is mainly the case when it is the matter of coupled technologies with other systems such as fuel cells, heat management, and batteries. Hydrogen is considered an energy carrier and its chemical energy can be converted into electricity through a chemical reaction with oxygen from a fuel cell. Therefore, coupling energy storage systems with renewable energy sources through an electrolyzer, which can transform electric energy into hydrogen chemical energy, is considered a high sustainable process of production and exploitation of renewable energies. Integrated systems are constituted by a metal hydride tank and a PEM fuel cell, in which the waste heat generated in the fuel cell is used to supply the necessary heat required for desorption of hydrogen from the tank. The field of application of the integrated power system is in combination with renewable sources: The hydrogen can be produced by electrolysis of water using the energy from a renewable source (e.g., photovoltaic); it is then stored and converted into electric energy by the proposed integrated power system, that allows energy storage in the form of hydrogen and its reuse when the renewable source is not available, for example, at night if solar power is exploited. The developed power system could replace batteries and could be applied in the case of a production plant not connected to the power grid, such as in remote areas. As an example, an integrated power system, showing a total energy production of 4.8 kW h, over more than 6 h of working activity, is reported in ref 4. In the SSH2S (Fuel Cell Coupled Solid-State Hydrogen Storage Tank) project, a solid-state hydrogen storage tank based on complex hydrides has been developed and it was fully integrated with a High-Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane (HT-PEM) fuel cell stack. The hydrogen storage tank was designed to feed a 1 kW HT-PEM stack for 2 h to be used for an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU).61 With respect to batteries, hydrides can be utilized as anodes with high capacity (e.g., 2 Ahg-1 for MgH2). A lot of effort has been expended to improve the cyclability, and significant results have been reached in a solid-state battery with LiBH4 solid electrolyte. Demonstration of high-energy density fuel cells with suitable cathodes will be the challenge of upcoming research studies.62,63 As mentioned for the beneficial contribution of electrodes, solid-state electrolytes based on borohydrides are a typical example that the battery community is now taking seriously along with the popular garnet-type solid electrolytes.64,65 It has been demonstrated that the ionic conductivity is a prerequisite for application in batteries, but unfortunately it is not win; in fact, other important issues need to be tackled, such as chemical compatibility, interfaces, heterogeneity, and mechanical properties, so important for the cell engineering and design, in addition to the structural and volumetric changes during cycling. At first, borohydrides meet some of these criteria regarding conductivity and ductility, (thermo)chemistry, and low-density materials. Future research might be directed to the understanding and assessment of interfaces and physical and mechanical properties of the selected solid-electrolyte and electrodes. The specificity of the application may become a determining aspect in the selection of the suitable configuration. Substantial research efforts are being conducted to study new approaches toward the utilization of borohydrides and closo-type complex hydrides in composites.66,67 Thanks to their ductility and ionic conductivity, borohydrides can be also employed as additives for binder-free solid-state batteries. Since the demonstration of LiBH4 thin film growth,68 this could be considered for mitigating the formation of dendrite and oxidation layers on the surface of lithium metal. Another direction is focused on the development of Mg2+ conducting solid electrolytes for application in Mg batteries, which offer higher volumetric capacity compared to lithium at low cost. At present, the technology can be only possible at high-T owing to the low ionic conductivity and Mg2+-ion mobility.69 In addition, metal hydrides can be utilized as optical hydrogen sensors for the detection of hydrogen at low pressure levels according to changes in the optical properties, which is a step forward regarding the increase of the safety for advanced hydrogenbased systems. Lastly, compared to the traditional conferences for hydrogen community (MH, E-MRS, Gordon, etc.) there no doubt that IRSEC is a particular place to meet scientists and experts in the African context undergoing full energy boom. The eighth edition of IRSEC will continue the tradition of drawing the best scientists in the field of sustainable energy, which will be held in Tangier (Morocco), November 25-28, 2020.

 Abstract:  The present work contributes to the knowledge of a particular microstructure in which numerous stripes emerge in the annealed La–Mg–Ni-based hydrogen storage alloys. Stripe-shaped structures characterized by electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been illustrated to be steps resulting from a step-growth mechanism of phase transformation during annealing. Nucleation of the La–Mg–Ni phases relies on the (0001) planes of the parent phase with a low mismatching configuration, leading to an orientation relationship of [101¯0]∥[101¯0] and (0001)//(0001) between the new and parent phases. Grain growth proceeds through a step-side face to avoid the stable phase boundaries on the step-terrace face, which is parallel to the (0001) planes of the new and parent phases. The present work also illustrates that nucleation of the new La–Mg–Ni structures can take place by introducing certain stacking faults under solid state, which provides different perspectives into regulating the microstructure by changing the annealing parameters. Moreover, the importance of the original microstructure, especially the effect of the grain size on the final phase constitution, is emphasized based on the present findings. © 2020

 Abstract:  Recently, the development of layered two-dimensional (2D) material-based nanostructured hybrids has witnessed a remarkable advancement as energy storage and conversion materials. Herein, we present an all-solid-state and scalable approach to integrate 2D-2D-type SnS2 and graphene-layered nanosheets (SnS2/G) and assessed its potential as an active material for the high-performance supercapacitor and electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this in situ solvent-free strategy, a tin precursor and graphite oxide (GO) were homogeneously ball-milled with surfeit yet nontoxic elemental sulfur and subjected to a moderate thermal treatment to obtain a unique 2D-2D-type SnS2/G nanohybrid. The characterization revealed that the in situ formed SnS2 nanosheets were uniformly distributed and wrapped within graphene layers. The resulting nanohybrids demonstrated a superior specific capacitance of 565 F g-1 and retain a significant charge-discharge cyclic stability (90%/3000 cycles). Similarly, a resultant symmetric device delivered a high energy density of 23.5 Wh kg-1 and power density 880 W kg-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. Furthermore, the resulting SnS2/G nanohybrid provided a much lower HER overpotential of 0.36 V than SnS2 (0.6 V) to attain a current density of 10 mA cm-2 in the alkaline electrolyte. The proposed strategy presents an environmentally benign avenue to integrate electrochemically active metal-sulfide-based 2D-2D-type nanostructured materials with superior energy storage and conversion capabilities. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Sustainable hydrogen production is attracting increasing attention and visible-light-driven water splitting is considered as one of the most promising approaches for hydrogen evolution and solar energy storage. Different materials have been screened at mild conditions in recent decades and 2-dimensional (2D) layered materials are considered good candidates for the photocatalytic water splitting reaction. 2D single layer MoS2 has shown its potential in various catalytic systems, and has also been used in photocatalytic water splitting reaction recently. However, current studies of MoS2 monolayers give low intrinsic activity, preventing it from practical applications. This is attributed to the rapid recombination of the photo-excited charge carriers at room temperature, resulting in poor quantum efficiency (QE). Herein, a state-of-the-art strategy to prolong the exciton lifetimes is reported, which is achieved by combining the 2D MoS2 nanosheets with solid state polar-faceted supports. The charge separation process can be facilitated by the strong local polarisation introduced by the polar-faceted supports, and tuned by changing the supports with different surface polarities. Polar oxide surface is the exposure of oxygen-terminated high energetic facet, which is known to give a net dipole moment perpendicular to its surface. Such variation in the surface properties of the support to the above metal would lead to a difference in metal-support interaction(s). The resulting composite structures show great enhancement toward the visible-light-driven photocatalytic water splitting reaction, giving hydrogen and oxygen evolution in a stoichiometric 2:1 ratio at elevated temperatures from pure water. Photocatalytic performances are improved by the prolonged exciton lifetimes and exceptional hydrogen evolution activity of 2977 μmol g−1 h−1 with impressive QEs are obtained over Ru-doped MoS2 nanosheets on polar ceria support, which is among the best of the reported results of similar catalytic systems to date. More excitingly, the linear relationship between the exciton lifetimes and strength of the local polarisation is also observed, indicating that the rational design of photocatalysts can be simply achieved via engineering their local polarisation by incorporation of polar-faceted materials. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

 Abstract:  Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a promising solid-state hydrogen storage material because of its low toxicity, high environmental stability and release of high-purity hydrogen. Nevertheless, the practical application of NaBH4 is still hampered by its high desorption temperature and slow hydrogen exchange kinetics. Using experimental and first-principles calculations approaches, the dehydrogenation properties and modifying mechanisms of NaBH4+10 wt%graphene composite acquired by ball-milling are systematically investigated in this work. The results show that the graphene plays a cooperative catalysis–confinement effect on NaBH4. X-ray diffraction analysis displays that no new phases formed due to the mutual inertia between NaBH4 and graphene during ball-milling. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy observations show that the NaBH4 particles are significantly refined after graphene addition, which effectively restrains the agglomeration of NaBH4 particles. Thermogravimetry testing and mass spectrometry testing indicate that the onset dehydrogenation temperature of the NaBH4+10 wt%graphene composite is decreased by about 114 °C relative to the milled pristine NaBH4. First-principles calculations reveal that the enhanced dehydrogenation properties of NaBH4 after graphene addition should be ascribed to the reduced dehydrogenation enthalpy of NaBH4 and strong binding energy between NaBH4 and graphene as well as the electron transfer from NaBH4 to graphene. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

 Abstract:  With the ever-growing dependency on electronic devices as well as the rapid development of electric vehicles, the demand for large-scale energy storage systems has risen significantly. Besides lithium-ion batteries, one alternative source of energy that has attracted tremendous attention is metal-air batteries as they possess high theoretical energy densities compared to other forms of batteries. Metal-air batteries employ metals such as iron, zinc, tungsten, or aluminum as the negative working electrodes and oxygen from the air as the positive working electrode. As the theoretical capacity of the metal-air batteries is determined by the negative electrodes, development is more focused on the metal electrode. Commonly, a metal-air battery in a liquid state with an alkaline aqueous solution as the electrolyte has a number of drawbacks, such as irreversibility of hydroxide ions conduction, fast capacity decay, electrode deformation, as well as hydrogen evolution during the charging process. As technology is moving toward Internet-of-Things and lightweight wearable devices, the bulkiness as well as weight of the batteries have never been more crucial. Therefore the heavier and leakage-prone liquid electrolyte-based metal-air batteries are deemed inappropriate for use as wearable devices. Therefore an alternative method to overcome both electrolyte leakage and hydrogen evolution is to utilize a solid electrolyte in an all-solid-state metal-air rechargeable battery. In this chapter, brief fundamentals of metal-air batteries focusing more on the Fe-air battery, current progress, and its future outlook will be discussed. The development of all-solid-state Fe-air batteries and their potential will also be mentioned. © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  The present work was focused on the studies of the effect of variation of stoichiometric composition of Ti–Zr based AB2±x Laves phase alloys by changing the ratio between A (Ti + Zr) and B (Mn + V + Fe + Ni) components belonging to both hypo-stoichiometric (AB1.90, AB1.95) and over-stoichiometric (AB2.08) alloys further to the stoichiometric AB2.0 composition to optimize their hydrogen storage behaviours and performances as the alloy anodes of nickel metal hydride batteries. AB2-xLa0.03 Laves type alloys (A = Ti0.15Zr0.85; B = Mn0.64–0.69V0.11–0.119Fe0.11–0.119Ni1.097–1.184; x = 0, 0.05 and 0.1) were arc melted and then homogenized by annealing. The studies involved probing of the phase-structural composition by X-Ray diffraction (XRD), together with studies of the microstructural state, hydrogen absorption–desorption and thermodynamic characteristics of gas–solid reactions and electrochemical charge-discharge performance, further to the impedance spectroscopy characterization. The alloys were probed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and XRD. These studies concluded that the alloys contained the main C15 FCC Laves type AB2 intermetallic co-existing with a secondary C14 hexagonal Laves phase and a small amount of LaNi intermetallic. The gaseous H storage capacity and electrochemical performances were found to be closely dependent on the stoichiometric compositions of the alloys. High discharge capacities approaching 500 mAh/g were achieved for the AB1.95 alloy. At 500 mA/g current density, the discharge capacity was maintained as high as 80%, with very low capacity retention after 500 cycles. The alloy which had the highest capacity retention after 500 cycles was found to be AB2.0 alloy. Furthermore, AB2.0 alloy showed an excellent cyclic stability together with a high hydrogen diffusion coefficient. Studies of hydrogen diffusion coefficients showed that annealing enhanced the H diffusion rates allowing advanced performance at high discharge current densities. This has been related to a higher content of C15 Laves compound which allows to reach a higher H mobility in contrast with higher storage capacity observed for the C14 Laves type polymorph. © 2020 The Authors

 Abstract:  Fundamental understanding of the confinement of water in porous coordination polymers (PCPs) is important not only with respect to their application, such as in gas storage and separation, but also for exploring confinement effects in nanoscale spaces. Here, we report the observation of water in an exotic state in the well-designed hydrophilic nanopores of PCPs. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction finds that nanoconfined water has an ordered structure that is characteristic in ices, but infrared spectroscopy reveals a significant number of broken hydrogen bonds that is characteristic in liquids. We find that their structural properties are quite similar to those of solid-liquid supercritical water predicted in hydrophobic nanospace at extremely high pressure. Our results will open up not only new potential applications of water in an exotic state in PCPs to control chemical reactions, but also experimental systems to clarify the existence of solid-liquid critical points. © 2020, The Author(s).

 Abstract:  Protein nanofibrils (PNFs) have been prepared by whey protein fibrillation at low pH and in the presence of different metal ions. The effect of the metal ions was systematically studied both in terms of PNF suspension gelation behavior and fibrillation kinetics. A high valence state and a small ionic radius (e.g., Sn4+) of the metal ion resulted in the formation of hydrogels already at a metal ion concentration of 30 mM, whereas an intermediate valence state and larger ionic radius (Co2+, Ni2+, Al3+) resulted in the hydrogel formation occurring at 60 mM. A concentration of 120 mM of Na+ was needed to form a PNF hydrogel, while lower concentrations showed liquid behaviors similar to the reference PNF solution where no metal ions had been introduced. The hydrogel mechanics were investigated at steady-state conditions after 24 h of incubation/gelation, revealing that more acidic (smaller and more charged) metal ions induced ca. 2 orders of magnitude higher storage modulus as compared to the less acidic metal ions (with smaller charge and larger radius) for the same concentration of metal ions. The viscoelastic nature of the hydrogels was attributed to the ability of the metal ions to coordinate water molecules in the vicinity of the PNFs. The presence of metal ions in the solutions during the growth of the PNFs typically resulted in curved fibrils, whereas an upper limit of the concentration existed when oxides/hydroxides were formed, and the hydrogels lost their gel properties due to phase separation. Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence was used to determine the rate of the fibrillation to form 50% of the total PNFs (t1/2), which decreased from 2.3 to ca. 0.5 h depending on the specific metal ions added.  ©

 Abstract:  The conditions determining network-forming and aggregation properties of hyaluronan on the mica surface were studied. The hyaluronan was deposited on the surface from aqueous and saline solutions and attached by a bivalent cation. The morphology of the immobilized assemblies was characterized by atomic force microscopy. The experimental results show that the morphology and size of the aggregates as well as the density of the interconnecting fibrillar network, both made of hyaluronan, at the liquid-solid phase interface are determined not only by its molecular weight or concentration in solution, but also by the dissolution conditions and storage time. These findings extend the current state of knowledge about the conformational variability of this biologically important polymer. Understanding the conformational variability is of great importance, as it governs the physiological functions of hyaluronan, as well as its processability and formulations.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen distribution in zirconium nuclear fuel claddings can often be non-uniform because of the high mobility of hydrogen interstitial atoms, raising the risk to the fuel rod integrity. Therefore, the assessment of hydrogen migration behavior is of great importance when considering its potential detrimental effects during spent fuel storage. Here, we present the quantitative results of hydrogen redistribution measured by high-resolution neutron imaging in conjunction with thermodynamic modeling. A duplex cladding, with a 150 μm external layer of low-tin Zircaloy-4, so-called liner, bonded to an inner standard Zircaloy-4 substrate, underwent various cooling rates subsequent to hydrogenation and solution heat treatment. The tube segments were measured using a state-of-the-art neutron imaging setup of PSI Neutron Microscope with an effective spatial resolution of 9.6 μm. The hydrogen concentration was quantified across the cladding wall thickness with a precision of 9 wppm, revealing the effect of cooling rate on hydrogen migration from the substrate into the liner. Depending on the cooling rate, hydrogen accumulation in the liner near the interface reached more than 1000 wppm, which consisted primarily of intragranular hydrides in the accumulation strip. The equilibrium concentration during solid solution treatment was identified to be lower in the liner than in the substrate. The thermodynamic calculations reveal that the hydrogen migration into the liner is attributed to the composition-induced difference in the reference chemical potential between the liner and the substrate, and the high precipitation rate promoted hydride accumulation near the interface instead of the liner interior. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Despite the fact that the affinities of both palladium and magnesium with hydrogen have been studied for many years, information about magnesium-palladium alloys is still incomplete. Although palladium is an extremely expensive metal and magnesium palladium alloys will likely never applied as solid-state hydrogen storage materials, the interaction of these alloys with hydrogen may be useful for broadening knowledge or finding applications as hydrogen splitters, catalysts, and hydrogen sensors. In this work, two types of calorimetric techniques were applied to measure the thermodynamic properties of magnesium-rich alloys from the Mg-Pd system (containing 97.7; 85.4; 80.6; 79.9; 72.3; 70.7; 64.5 at% of Mg respectively). The solution calorimetric method was used to determine the heat of solution of liquid magnesium and palladium in liquid tin. Additionally, the standard enthalpies of formation of six alloys corresponding to the intermetallic phases of the Mg-rich region were measured. These alloys were prepared from pure Mg and Pd, which were melted in a glove box filled with high purity argon, with a very low concentration of impurities. All the obtained alloys were structurally analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDS) methods. Moreover, DSC studies were used to determine the transformation temperatures in the Mg-rich region. The values of the standard formation enthalpy of the studied alloys were determined to be −27.3 ± 0.8 kJ/mol at., −33.4 ± 0.9 kJ/mol at., −35.2 ± 1.4 kJ/mol at., −44.2 ± 0.9 kJ/mol at., −46.0 ± 0.7 kJ/mol at., and −54.3 ± 2.3 kJ/mol at.

 Abstract:  Monohydric alcohols have been used as promising phase change materials (PCMs) for low-temperature latent heat storage. However, the heat storage/retrieval rates are limited due to the low thermal conductivity of such alcohols. In this work, nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations were performed to study the microscopic heat conduction in example monohydric alcohols, i.e., 1-dodecanol (C12H26O), 1-tetradecanol (C14H30O), and 1-hexadecanol (C16H34O). A simplified ideal crystal model was proposed to exploit the potential for improving the thermal conductivity of monohydric alcohols. The effect of ideal crystalline structures, especially the contribution of the hydroxyl group, on the microscopic heat conduction process was analyzed. The thermal conductivity of the ideal crystals of the various monohydric alcohols was predicted to be more than twice as compared to that of their respective solids. The major thermal resistance in the ideal crystals was found around the molecular interfaces, as a result of the excellent heat conduction performance along the linear molecular chains. The calculated vibrational density of states (VDOS) and interfacial heat transfer were then investigated. When the interfaces are surrounded by hydroxyl groups as walls, strong hydrogen bond (HB) interactions were observed. The interfacial heat transfer coefficient of the ideal crystalline structures of 1-tetradecanol was found to reach up to ∼735.6 MW/m2 W. It was elucidated that the high interfacial heat transfer rate is clearly related to the stronger intermolecular interactions. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

 Abstract:  Diffusion of H atoms in Pd-based alloy usually takes place through octahedral voids for face centered cubic (FCC) metals and alloys. Transition metals are preferred as the alloying element for Pd-based alloy because electron removal and addition from Pd, and the number of vacant d-states of Pd can be regulated by lacking the deformation of electronic structure of Pd. In addition, the alloying alters a lattice constant and hydrogen permeability, thereby improving the mechanical, chemical stabilities of Pd-based devices and reduce the expensive cost of Pd raw material. High entropy alloys (HEA) have been investigated as an important contributor in field of microelectronics as a catalyst, diffusion barrier, and anode materials for a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). HEA's of Pd, Ag, Ni, Cu, Au, Rh, Pt and Ir are designed empirically and their lattice constants, corresponding an octahedral void size are analyzed with pure Pd, thus suggesting them as a potential candidate for hydrogen storage applications in the future. The core reason for designing HEA is to overcome the problem of cost and availability of Pd and Pd-rich binary alloys. In this paper, we calculated the lattice parameters using the Vergards law, octahedral void size, lattice distortion and cost for PdAg-based HEA's of 20 combinations. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

 Abstract:  Carbon black (CB) filled butadiene (BR) (Cis-1,4-polybutadiene) and natural (NR) (Cis-1,4-polyisoprene) rubber compounds containing CB in 60–100 per hundred (phr) proportions were investigated for their pressure/time-dependent electrical conductivity. Due to their high deformability, the percolation thresholds for CB–BR and CB-NR compounds were functions of pressures (compression loads) applied. Resistivity of such compounds decreased with time and compressive load levels. Storage moduli, G', as well as the loss moduli, G” and the dynamic viscosities, η* of the compounds were evaluated to assess viscoelastic response of the compounds' conductivities under pressure. The storage and loss moduli values for both the CB-BR and the CB-NR compounds decreased with increasing strain levels, indicating that the rate of increase in conductivity is expected to increase at higher compressive loads. The storage moduli increased with increasing frequency (rate), indicating that the rate of increase in conductivity should be lower at higher rates of compressive load application. Comparison of variations in conductivity between the CB–BR and CB-NR compounds as functions of time and pressure, however, revealed that, overall, the conductivity levels are also strongly dependent on the nature of the molecular structure of these rubber materials and their initial interactions with CB during compounding, and the resulting dispersion levels of CB. Once such dispersion structure is established, the overall difference in conductivity levels for the CB–BR and CB-NR compounds remain approximately unchanged for given time and pressure conditions for the cases where high CB fill levels (~90 phr) are used and asymptotic conductivity values are reached. The experimental results revealed that because of the presence of higher number (~2-fold) of hydrogen side atoms on the linear BR chains, CB–BR compound forms more physical crosslinks (mostly due to hydrogen bonding) in comparison to the CB-NR compound resulting in more effective CB dispersion and higher conductivity. Such higher efficiency in CB dispersion and percolation in BR is further implied by higher conductivities despite higher G' and η* values for the CB–BR compound in comparison to the CB-NR compound. © Copyright © 2019 Sancaktar and Basan.

 Abstract:  Recently, solid-state aqueous Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs) have become the most promising wearable storage systems to replace Li-ion batteries owing to their advantages such as high safety and environmental friendliness. However, the critical challenge is to develop stable and robust cathode materials for excellent Zn2+ storage. In this study, a hydrated vanadium pentoxide/reduced graphene oxide-polyvinyl alcohol (V2O5⋅nH2O/rGO-PVA, abbreviated as VOH/rGO-P) film was synthesized as a binder-free cathode for solid-state aqueous ZIBs. The addition of PVA not only increases the layer spacing of VOH and forms a strong hydrogen bond network with GO and water molecules, but also enhances the mechanical properties of the film. As a binder-free cathode for solid-state aqueous ZIBs, the VOH/rGO-P film attains excellent electrochemical capacity as high as 481 mAh∙g−1 at 0.1 A∙g−1. Such a high specific capacity indicates that the VOH/rGO-P film shows great potential for the next generation solid-state aqueous ZIBs. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

 Abstract:  Lithium borohydride is a potential candidate not only for hydrogen storage (high hydrogen capacity ∼18.5 wt%), but it can also be used as a solid electrolyte due to the high conductivity (∼10-3 S cm-1) of its high-temperature phase. However, it cannot be utilized as a hydrogen storage material practically because of its high stability and high decomposition temperature. During our recent work on LiBH4 as a solid electrolyte for Bi2X3 anode materials in all-solid-state Li-ion batteries, a thermochemical side reaction was observed. This thermochemical reaction restricted the potential window of electrochemical cycling, thus lowering the overall capacity of the electrode material. However, on the other hand, it allowed a significant destabilization of LiBH4. This motivated us to investigate the effect of bismuth chalcogenides on the stability of LiBH4 in detail. In this work, we prepared LiBH4 composites with bulk and nanostructures of Bi2X3 and investigated the minimum decomposition temperature of LiBH4. In order to understand the detailed reaction mechanism, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were performed after milling as well as at different temperatures according to TG-DTA experiments. The onset desorption temperature of LiBH4 could be lowered down to 50 °C by the infusion of 50 wt% Bi2S3 nanoflowers. This work not only enabled us to achieve efficient destabilization of LiBH4 but also provided a significant understanding of the side reaction during the use of LiBH4 as a solid electrolyte for Bi2X3 chalcogenides. It will be helpful in tuning the electrolyte-electrode combination without any side reaction, thus improving the cycling stability. This journal is  © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Understanding the electrode/electrolyte interfacial chemistry is the cornerstone of designing lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with superior performance. Graphite has been exclusively utilized as the anode material in state-of-the-art LIBs, whose interfacial chemistry has a profound impact on battery life and power delivery. However, current understanding of the graphite/electrolyte interface is still incomplete because of its intricate nature, which has driven unremitting explorations and breakthroughs in the past few decades. On the one hand, the applications of emerging experimental and computational tools have led researchers to re-examine several decades-old problems, such as the underlying mechanism of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and the co-intercalation mystery. On the other hand, from anion-derived interfacial chemistry to artificial interphases, novel interfacial chemistry for graphite is being proposed to replace the traditional ethylene carbonate-derived SEI for better performances. By summarizing the latest advances in the emerging interfacial chemistry of graphite anodes in LIBs, this review affords a fresh perspective on interface science and engineering towards next-generation energy storage devices.

 Abstract:  We demonstrate the reinforcement of a previously inaccessible norbornene-silane with a stiff, bio-based nanofiller. Poly(5-triethoxysilyl-2-norbornene) (PTESN), a glassy and thermally stable polymer, was combined with cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and solvent cast from toluene to form reinforced materials. Composite films showed excellent translucency and no visible aggregation, which was supported by scanning electron micrographs that showed no signs of CNC aggregation within the polymer matrix. Reinforcement was evident at the moderate loading of 5 wt% CNC, showing a statistically significant enhancement for Young's modulus and even greater reinforcement for 20 wt% CNC loading for Young's modulus (540 MPa vs. 970 MPa) and storage modulus at 25 °C (400 MPa vs. 1200 MPa). We suspect that there is a strong interaction between the polymer and CNC filler based upon the increase of thermal degradation temperature of the CNCs increasing, for example from 278 °C to 295 °C at 10 wt% CNCs. These interactions were probed via solid-state NMR, which suggests that no covalent bonding occurs between the triethoxylsilyl substituents of the polymer and the CNCs. We therefore hypothesize that hydrogen bonding interactions between PTESN and CNCs are responsible for the increased thermal stability and reinforcement of the polymer material. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen energy is a key role in novel renewable energy production/consumption technologies. Traditional hydrogen energy systems are suffered from low density, high production cost, low efficiency, and storage complications. With the advent of solid-state hydrogen storage technology, many of above shortcomings are fulfilled, however, there are several unknown points, particularly in mixed metal oxides, which need more attention.

In this work, we fabricate a self-healing polyaniline–poly (vinyl alcohol) (PANI–PVA) composite hydrogels with excellent mechanical characters, brilliant rate capability, and good electrochemical performance. The synergistic effects offered by flexibility of PVA macromolecular chains, high electrical conductivity of carbon nanotubes, reversible hydrogen bonding between phytic acid and PVA, and pseudocapacitance of PANI give PANI–PVA hydrogels the stated advantages.

The fabricated supercapacitor not only delivers an outstanding cycle life (97.5% capacitance retention after 1000 galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles), but also displays good self-healing properties (capacitance retention of about 95% after 10 healing cycles).

 Abstract:  Hydrogen has been considered as a potential candidate for the replacement of fossil fuels in future due to its renewability, abundance, ease in production, environmental friendliness and high energy efficiency. In this regard, chemical storage of hydrogen in solid state of metal hydrides is the safest method for stationary and portable applications since these can be functioned at lower pressure and ambient temperature. Among the desirable metal hydrides, the intermetallic compound TiFe of cubic CsCl-type structure is well known for absorbing hydrogen reversibly up to 1.9 wt.% to form β-FeTiH and γ-FeTiH2 phases. In this paper, we have discussed the historic background outlining the recent developments on the microstructural modifications, activation kinetics and processing routes of TiFe intermetallic alloys toward the improvement of hydrogenation properties. An in-depth microstructural analysis of TiFe alloys has been presented in terms of crystallography, hydride phase formation and hydrogenation mechanisms. The rate-controlling steps for the mechanisms of (de)hydrogenation processes of TiFe intermetallics have been explained in details. It was found that the rate-controlling steps of the hydriding reaction were dependent on the fraction of β-hydride phase. Intensive research activities were carried out to improve the first hydrogenation kinetics that can be categorized into two groups: alloying and mechanical activation. The mechanisms for improved hydrogenation kinetics in both cases have been explained. Lastly, various fabrication processes to produce TiFe alloys have been presented and correlated with cost-effectiveness and hydrogen-storage capability. Therefore, the focus of this article is to present the basic knowledge and recent developments on TiFe intermetallic alloys for future hydrogen-storage applications which will be beneficial to researchers and practitioners in the field of interest. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

 Abstract:  Azobenzene containing polymers have been used in the development of materials and devices responsive to light, devices for optical storage information, with shape-changing and shape-memory capacities, surface-relief grating, holograms, etc. Poly(urethane-urea)s (PUU) based on a hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG-PUU), on a hydrophobic polycaprolactone diol (PCL-PUU) polyols, and on an equimolar mixture of them (PEG/PCL-PUU), 4,4′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and 4,4′-diaminoazobenzene (DAAB), as a chain extender, were synthesized by a two-step route. PUU were characterized with respect to their chemical structure, molar masses, thermal and dynamic mechanical properties, and spectroscopic properties. The kinetics of the photo- and thermal-induced isomerization were studied in DMF solutions. The isomerization rate constant was two orders of magnitude higher for DAAB compared with PUU in DMF solution, except for PEG/PCL-PUU, for which the rate constant was half the value observed for DAAB. The amphiphilic nature of the PUU resulted in aggregates in DMF and, therefore, the azo isomerization for PEG-PUU and PCL-PUU occurred in a solid-state-like environment. On the other hand, PEG/PCL-PUU presented unimers and aggregates in DMF and the isomerization of azo groups in free PUU chains was faster. The PUU were semicrystalline and thermo-mechanically stable up 150 °C due to the hydrogen bonding involving urea, urethane and ester groups. The aggregates size in DMF solution, as well as the dynamic mechanical properties of the PUU, were sensitive to photo- and thermo-induced isomerization. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

 Abstract:  Surface ligands facilitate the high dispersibility of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) during synthesis and storage, and also play a key role in passivating surface traps. The most commonly used ligands [oleic acid (OA) or oleylamine (OLA)] are insulating long organic linkers, which prevent efficient charge transfer between QDs and exhibit limited surface passivation, thus significantly reducing the overall performance of QDs based optoelectronic devices. Here we develop a solid-state ligands exchange process for PbS/CdS QDs sensitized TiO2 photoanode with hybrid inorganic ligands (I− and SCN−) to replace the original insulating OA ligands and passivate the surface traps. The hybrid surface passivation of PbS/CdS QDs removes ~75% of insulating OA ligands. The saturated photocurrent density of the photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells improves significantly through the hybrid ligand exchange process, reaching a value of 4.0 mA cm−2 which is more than two times higher compared to the control PEC cells. In addition, the long-term stability of PEC cells is better for the hybrid ligand exchange process (only 15% loss of its initial photocurrent density) than the control PEC cells (38% loss). Our results indicate that hybrid ligands engineering is a promising pathway to achieve high performance and stable PEC cells for hydrogen generation. © 2020

 Abstract:  In the context of the growing hydrogen (H2) economy, the demand for H2 storage materials is high, and metal borohydrides are of particular interest. Magnesium borohydride, Mg(BH4)2, has one of the highest hydrogen capacities of all known metal hydrides (14.9 wt % H) but suffers from high operating temperatures, slow kinetics for (de)hydrogenation, and the loss of capacity upon cycling. Strategies to address these challenges include nanoencapsulation and the use of chemical additives. This work is the first to utilize these two strategies simultaneously by using atomic layer deposition (ALD). For this new approach to modify borohydrides, we chose the well-studied Al2O3 ALD process using trimethylaluminum and water. Although there has been limited use of aluminum-based additives for Mg(BH4)2, we demonstrate that the low-temperature H2 capacity was doubled, desorption kinetics were increased by a factor of 3, and 100 cycles of Al2O3 suppressed the release of diborane compared to the uncoated Mg(BH4)2. We identified that the use of trimethylaluminum and water in the ALD process affected the decomposition pathway and that the Al2O3 film growth is dominated by infiltration due to the high porosity of the γ-phase Mg(BH4)2. From these results, the potential of ALD as a method to functionalize solid-state H2 storage materials is inferred, and recommendations for future ALD processes are presented.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen in solid metals can cause accidental fracture of engineering alloys in service, and thus has become an important issue in industrial applications, such as power generation, hydrogen storage, petroleum transport and hydrocarbon extraction. Through experiments, it was found that the elimination rate of hydrogen atoms in high strength alloy was greatly accelerated, and the equilibrium hydrogen content in the samples was decreased to a quite low level. The electric current provided an additional free energy term for the alloy system based on the current density distribution. The electrical free energy tends to reduce the electrical resistance of the system. Meanwhile, hydrogen atoms in lattice and traps caused the local electrical conductivity changes, thereby changing the current distribution and bringing the free energy of the alloy system to a new state. In this case, the diffusion activation energy and the height of energy barrier for hydrogen trapping sites were decreased. As a result, the diffusion coefficient became larger and the irreversible hydrogen were decreased, so the content of diffusible hydrogen was increased, and the hydrogen removal was accelerated. In principle, the proposed treatment helps to remove hydrogen from solid metal to a rather low level to avoid further hydrogen-induced damages, and should work for majority of alloys especially the high strength alloys. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Lithium (Li) metal has been considered as the ultimate anode material for next-generation rechargeable batteries due to its ultra-high theoretical specific capacity (3860 mAh g−1) and the lowest reduction voltage (−3.04 V vs the standard hydrogen electrode). However, the dendritic Li formation, uncontrolled interfacial reactions, and huge volume variations lead to unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, low Coulombic efficiency and hence short cycling lifetime. Designing artificial solid electrolyte interphase (artificial SEI) films on the Li metal electrode exhibits great potential to solve the aforementioned problems and enable Li–metal batteries with prolonged lifetime. Polymer materials with good ionic conductivity, superior processability and high flexibility are considered as ideal artificial SEI film materials. In this review, according to the ionic conductive groups, recent advances in polymeric artificial SEI films are summarized to afford a deep understanding of Li ion plating/stripping behavior and present design principles of high-performance artificial SEI films in achieving stable Li metal electrodes.

 Abstract:  Anode materials are key components of batteries that significantly impact their specific energy and power. Li metal is considered as the ultimate anode due to its high theoretical capacity (∼3860 mA h/g) and low redox potential (−3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode). Specifically, rechargeable Li metal batteries (LMBs) with enabled safety promise to surpass the energy density of current Li-ion batteries. Unfortunately, the apparently inevitable growth of dendritic Li, electrolyte consumption, the severe volume changes and the connected potential safety risks of LMBs limit their practical application. Recent strategies based on manipulation of electrolyte chemistry, interface engineering, and structure modification of Li host have reportedly achieved improvement. At the moment, the trend is to move towards all-solid-state LMBs. However, there are serious challenges in terms of low ionic conductivity, poor interfacial contact, and sluggish kinetics.

 Abstract:  Magnesium hydride (MgH2) and titanium hydride (TiH2) are two potential candidates for solid-state hydrogen storage, but strong hydride formation energy in these hydrides undesirably results in their high dehydrogenation temperature. First-principles calculations show that the metastable hydrides in the MgH2–TiH2 system have low hydrogen binding energy, which makes them more appropriate for low-temperature hydrogen storage. In this study, severe plastic deformation (SPD) via the high-pressure torsion (HPT) method is applied to the MgH2–TiH2 system to synthesize metastable hydrides. While MgH2 transforms to a high-pressure orthorhombic γ phase, TiH2 does not exhibit any cubic-to-tetragonal phase transformation even by HPT processing at cryogenic temperature. Application of large strains by 400 HPT turns to the immiscible MgH2/TiH2 composite results in atomic-scale mixing and formation of nanostructured ternary Mg–Ti–H hydride with the metastable FCC structure and lower dehydrogenation temperature than TiH2. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

 Abstract:  Efficient hydrogen release from ammonia borane (AB) with a striking hydrogen content (19.6 wt%) via thermolysis provides a promising pathway for on-board applications utilizing hydrogen energy. However, the sluggish kinetics at low temperatures and high energy consumption of thermal dehydrogenation are major obstacles for hydrogen release from AB. Herein, a novel solar-driven strategy for hydrogen production from AB at low temperature is proposed, in which Ti2O3 is utilized as a full-spectrum light absorber for photothermal-activating solid-state AB reactants to produce hydrogen. Through a reduction transformation method, nanoscale Ti2O3 particles with high chemical stability and narrow band gap are prepared, realizing a rapid production of 2.0 equivalents of hydrogen from AB at ambient temperature, with an excellent recyclable and full-spectrum-responsive photothermal dehydrogenation. Importantly, a record high photothermal activation efficiency of 35% is achieved with nanoscale Ti2O3 particles due to an enhanced local photothermal effect contributed by improved light absorption and decreased thermal conduction. Moreover, assisted with CuCl2 promoter, a release of 2.0 equivalents of hydrogen under 1.0 solar irradiation at 70 °C is successfully achieved, revealing its potential applications in practical vehicles based on proton exchange membrane fuel cells. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH

 Abstract:  Hydrogen continues to receive increased attention as the most promising energy carrier enabling sustainable and eco-friendly energy systems. Despite the various advantages of hydrogen fuel, storing hydrogen in a light-weight and compact form is the barrier towards the commercialization of the hydrogen technologies. Thus, the availability of a reliable, inexpensive, safe and efficient hydrogen storage technology is crucial to support and foster the transition to a hydrogen-powered world. Among the possible hydrogen storage solutions, storing hydrogen in the solid-state, such as metal hydrides, is the safest and most attractive method for on-board hydrogen storage. The metal hydrides can release highly pure hydrogen, via a low-pressure endothermic process, suitable to be used directly in the hydrogen fuel cell devices.

 Abstract:  The interfacial contact between the semiconductor and the electrode can effectively affect the device performance through the penetration of metal atoms in semiconductors from the grain boundaries. Thus, how to design a novel molecule with few grain boundaries, namely, large grain size, in solid state is an important task to achieve excellent memory device with high reproducibility.

 Abstract:  Boron and Nitrogen co-doped holey graphene aerogels (BN-HGA) are fabricated using ammonia borane as triple-functional precursor. The as-prepared BN-HGA possesses high specific surface area (249 m2 g−1) and rich B–N motifs with high surface polarity, which contributes to the rich and stable redox sites for the enhanced pseudo-capacitance. Moreover, the high hydrogen content in the ammonia borane cultures a reducing environment to preserve the integrity of carbon matrix, which gives rise to the high electronic conductivity. In addition, the well-developed hierarchically porous structure facilitates the ion diffusion in the electrode. Thanks to these structural merits, the BN-HGA electrode furnishes good specific capacitance of 456 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in three-electrode systems using sulfuric acid as electrolyte. Meanwhile, the all-solid-state flexible supercapacitors based on the symmetric BN-HGA electrodes demonstrate high specific capacitance (345 mF cm −2 at 1 mA cm −2) and outstanding rate performance (80% retention at 20 mA cm −2). Furthermore, the flexible supercapacitor exhibits pleasant flexibility with marginable capacity loss as bent to arbitrary angles, which endows it a promising device for wearable energy storage. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

 Abstract:  Amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is an important precursor in the biomineralization of crystalline CaCO3. In nature, it serves as a storage material or as a permanent structural element, whose lifetime is regulated by an organic matrix. The relevance of ACC in materials science is primarily related to our understanding of CaCO3 crystallization pathways and CaCO3/(bio)polymer nanocomposites. ACC can be synthesized by liquid-liquid phase separation, and it is typically stabilized with macromolecules. We have prepared ACC by milling calcite in a planetary ball mill. Phosphate ""impurities""were added in the form of monetite (CaHPO4) to substitute the carbonate anions, thereby stabilizing ACC by substitutional disorder. The phosphate anions do not simply replace the carbonate anions. They undergo shear-driven acid/base and condensation reactions, where stoichiometric (10%) phosphate contents are required for the amorphization to be complete. The phosphate anions generate a strained network that hinders ACC recrystallization kinetically. The amorphization reaction and the structure of BM-ACC were studied by quantitative Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and solid state 31P, 13C, and 1H magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which are highly sensitive to symmetry changes of the local environment. In the first - and fast - reaction step, the CO32- anions are protonated by the HPO42- groups. The formation of unprecedented hydrogen carbonate (HCO3-) and orthophosphate anions appears to be the driving force of the reaction, because the phosphate group has a higher Coulomb energy and the tetrahedral PO43- unit can fill space more efficiently. In a competing second - and slow - reaction step, pyrophosphate anions are formed in a condensation reaction. No pyrophosphates are formed at higher carbonate contents. High strain leads to such a large energy barrier that any reaction is suppressed. Our findings aid in the understanding of the mechanochemical amorphization of calcium carbonate and emphasize the effect of impurities for the stabilization of the amorphous phases in general. Our approach allowed the synthesis of new amorphous alkaline earth defect variants containing the unique HCO3- anion. Our approach outlines a general strategy to obtain new amorphous solids for a variety of carbonate/phosphate systems that offer promise as biomaterials for bone regeneration. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Polymers bearing hydrogen storage units store hydrogen gas via chemical bond formation, and have inherent advantages as quasi-solid polymeric hydrogen carriers, such as handling easiness and high safety. A recent study demonstrated that a poly(6-vinyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline) gel-like solid was dehydrogenated over 5 h under 120°C and air, and then the material was reversibly hydrogenated under 60°C and ambient hydrogen pressure in the presence of an iridium complex catalyst. The present work aimed to improve the dehydrogenation rate via the substitution of methyl groups for hydrogen atoms on carbon atoms adjacent to the nitrogen atoms in the quinoxaline unit. The dramatic improvement was attributed to the electron donating property of methyl group, and stabilization of the dehydrogenated state. The poly(6-vinyl-2,3-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline) gel-like solid was rapidly dehydrogenated within 2 h under the same mild conditions.

 Abstract:  Applications of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) in energy storage devices, solar cells, electrocatalysts, and sensors require good electrical conductivity. However, neither of the current ways to prepare conductive MoS2 (lithium intercalation and hydrothermal processes) is easily amenable to scale-up. A possible alternative pathway is the modulation of the electronic properties of the semiconducting form of MoS2 through structural defects. Here, we report the preparation of nanoscale conductive MoS2 flakes by treating exfoliated 2H-MoS2 with dilute aqueous hydrogen peroxide at room temperature. Sheet resistance measurements as well as Raman and photoelectron spectroscopy reveal the partial formation of hydrogen molybdenum bronze (HxMoO3) and substoichiometric MoO3-y, which help tune the conductivity of the nanometer-scale thin films without impacting the sulfur-to-molybdenum ratio. We have cast the material into thin film networks to fabricate highly stable chemiresistive pH sensors.

The electrocatalyst shows high and stable electrocatalytic performance, with a half-wave potential of 0.82 V for oxygen reduction reaction and an overpotential at 10 mA cm-2 for oxygen evolution reaction (0.34 V) and hydrogen evolution reaction (0.163 V), which outperform the metal-organic framework-derived transition metal sulfide catalysts reported so far.

The present chapter deals with the challenges of the typical solid form of hydrogen-storing possibilities using a metal hydride-based technique. Metal hydrides are one of the front runners in the storage process of hydrogen due to its superiorities concerned with cost, safety, handling, and capability of storage. Yet problems prevail as the activation at the beginning is not to the level of satisfaction and the absorption level is a matter of concern. The capacity of hydrogen storage is higher than liquid- and gas-based storage, but not sufficient for the continuous run of vehicles in comparison to conventional fueling.

 Abstract:  A nanocomposite material based on copper(II) oxide (CuO) and its utilization as a highly selective and stable gas-responsive electrical switch for hydrogen sulphide (H2S) detection is presented. The material can be applied as a sensitive layer for H2S monitoring, e.g., in biogas gas plants. CuO nanoparticles are embedded in a rigid, nanoporous silica (SiO2) matrix to form an electrical percolating network of low conducting CuO and, upon exposure to H2S, highly conducting copper(II) sulphide (CuS) particles. By steric hindrance due to the silica pore walls, the structure of the network is maintained even though the reversible reaction of CuO to CuS is accompanied by significant volume expansion. The conducting state of the percolating network can be controlled by a variety of parameters, such as temperature, electrode layout, and network topology of the porous silica matrix. The latter means that this new type of sensing material has a structure-encoded detection limit for H2S, which offers new application opportunities. The fabrication process of the mesoporous CuO@SiO2 composite as well as the sensor design and characteristics are described in detail.

 Abstract:  Hydride-forming alloys are currently considered reliable and suitable hydrogen storage materials because of their relatively high volumetric densities, and reversible H2 absorption/desorption kinetics, with high storage capacity. Nonetheless, their practical use is obstructed by several factors, including deterioration and slow hydrogen absorption/desorption kinetics resulting from the surface chemical action of gas impurities. Lately, common strategies, such as spark plasma sintering, mechanical alloying, melt spinning, surface modification and alloying with other elements have been exploited, in order to overcome kinetic barriers. Through these techniques, improvements in hydriding kinetics has been achieved, however, it is still far from that required in practical application. In this review, we provide a critical overview on the effect of mechanical alloying of various metal hydrides (MHs), ranging from binary hydrides (CaH2, MgH2, etc) to ternary hydrides (examples being Ti-Mn-N and Ca-La-Mg-based systems), that are used in solid-state hydrogen storage, while we also deliver comparative study on how the aforementioned alloy preparation techniques affect H2 absorption/desorption kinetics of different MHs. Comparisons have been made on the resultant material phases attained by mechanical alloying with those of melt spinning and spark plasma sintering techniques. The reaction mechanism, surface modification techniques and hydrogen storage properties of these various MHs were discussed in detail.

 Abstract:  This paper presents a colloidal binary composite phase change storage material prepared using inorganic–organic phase-change materials (PCMs) to improve the thermal conductivity of the organic PCM and solve the supercooling and phase separation problems associated with inorganic PCMs. Samples of disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate (DHPD)/capric acid (CA) were prepared using a sol-gel method. These samples were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal conductivity analyses, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-Ray diffraction (XRD). First, the eutectic mixture ratio for a DHPD-CA binary system was theoretically predicted. An analysis of the DSC curve and the two-phase diagram of the eutectic system reveals that the colloidal mixture is close to the eutectic state when the DHPD/CA ratio is 7:3. The results of FTIR spectroscopy and XRD revealed that DHPD and CA in the colloidal mixture did not undergo a chemical reaction, indicating the occurrence of physical mixing. Second, the melting temperature of the composite material was 33.8 °C, the degree of supercooling was 0.9 °C, the melting enthalpy of phase change was 168.8 J g−1, and the thermal conductivity was 0.468 W m−1K−1 at 15 °C. Moreover, after 300 accelerated cold–hot cycles, the thermal properties and morphology of the colloidal binary composite were stable. The addition of CA reduced the degree of supercooling of the DHPD. Furthermore, the addition of DHPD improved the phase-change latent heat and thermal conductivity of CA, thereby reducing the cost of the composite material. The material presented can be used in passive solar energy applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  We explored the influences of the addition of K2NbF7 by mechanical-milling on the dehydrogenation properties of NaAlH4. The results revealed that the addition of K2NbF7 to NaAlH4 decreases the dehydrogenation temperature and improves the dehydrogenation kinetic. The 10 wt% K2NbF7-doped NaAlH4 starts to desorb hydrogen at ∼100 °C and ∼204 °C for the first and second stages of dehydrogenation, respectively, which were ∼80 °C and ∼36 °C lower than the as-milled NaAlH4. For the dehydrogenation kinetic measurement at 150 °C, the K2NbF7-doped NaAlH4 releases ∼2.0 wt% hydrogen in 25 min, which is 10 times faster than as-milled NaAlH4. From the Kissinger calculation, the activation energies for the dehydrogenation process of K2NbF7-doped NaAlH4 are ∼84.6 kJ mol−1 for the first stage of dehydrogenation and ∼75.1 kJ mol−1 for the second stage of dehydrogenation. These activation energies are lower, about 33.3 and 44.9 kJ mol−1, compared with the undoped NaAlH4. The catalytic role of the active species (NbF4 and Al3Nb) that formed during the heating process and the reduction of particle size due to the milling process are the factors that presumably influence the reduction of the onset decomposition temperature and improvement in the dehydrogenation kinetic of the K2NbF7-doped NaAlH4 composite. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors (ASSSs) are excellent energy storage devices for portable/wearable electronics, although the development of an excellent comprehensive performance film electrode for the extraordinary flexible ASSSs still faces a great challenge. Here, bendable, foldable and anti-exfoliative Ti3C2Tx MXene-based films utilized as supercapacitor electrodes are reported. Polyaniline/Ti3C2Tx composites (i-PANI@Ti3C2Tx) were prepared by in situ oxidant-free polymerization of aniline on Ti3C2Tx nanosheets with p-phenylenediamine (PPD) as an initiator. Lignosulfonate (Lig) and Ti3C2Tx were constructed into a compact composite (Lig@Ti3C2Tx) film based on the hydrogen bonds formed between Lig and Ti3C2Tx. The Lig@Ti3C2Tx/i-PANI@Ti3C2Tx(5/5) hybrid film was produced by vacuum-assisted filtration of the mixed two composite dispersions. The as-prepared films can be arbitrarily deformed (such as bending and folding). They show high tensile strength and vertical-plane (the plane of film) tensile strength with 33.2 and 0.28 MPa for the i-PANI@Ti3C2Tx film, 75.4 and 0.77 MPa for the Lig@Ti3C2Tx film, and 53.7 and 0.58 MPa for the Lig@Ti3C2Tx/i-PANI@Ti3C2Tx(5/5) film (those of Ti3C2Tx film are 17.4 and 0.21 MPa), respectively. The enhanced vertical-plane tensile strength of the as-prepared composite films indicates that the large binding force generated between the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets can effectively prevent the exfoliation of films. The electrodes of the as-prepared i-PANI@Ti3C2Tx, Lig@Ti3C2Tx and Lig@Ti3C2Tx/i-PANI@Ti3C2Tx(5/5) films assembled into symmetric flexible ASSSs can deliver excellent specific capacitances of 310 F g-1 (∼1001 F cm-3), 271 F g-1 (∼881 F cm-3) and 295 F g-1 (∼959 F cm-3), respectively. In addition, the corresponding supercapacitors exhibit ultrahigh energy densities of 34.8, 30.6 and 33.3 W h L-1, respectively. It is expected that the as-prepared MXene-based films can be applied in various fields, such as electromagnetic-interference shielding and batteries. Furthermore, the as-prepared flexible ASSSs can be practically used as a wearable energy storage device. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are promising clean energy conversion devices in residential, transportation, and portable applications. Currently, a high-pressure tank is the state-of-the-art mode of hydrogen storage; however, the energy cost, safety, and portability (or volumetric hydrogen storage capacity) presents a major barrier to the widespread dissemination of PEMFCs.

Use of a gas impermeable SPP-QP (a polyphenylene-based PEM) enhances the operable time, reaching up to ca. 10.2 s mgHSP−1, which is more than a factor of two longer than that (3.90 s mgHSP−1) for a Nafion NRE-212 membrane cell.

 Abstract:  Rechargeable nickel-zinc battery is regarded as a prospective choice for next-generation energy storage device due to its good safety, environmental friendliness and high energy density. However, zinc anode inevitably suffers from uncontrollable growth of zinc dendrites and the dissolution of zinc metal in high-concentration alkaline electrolytes, resulting in poor cycle stability and severely hampering the widespread applications of nickel-zinc batteries. Herein, a unique zinc anode with artificial solid electrolyte interface (ASEI) is facilely constructed via the rolling-tearing of tin and zinc foils and subsequent surface-based chemical reaction in a lead salt solution. The as-prepared ASEI composed of lead film has an efficient protective effect on preventing the dissolution of zinc anode. Meanwhile, the lead element and residual tin can not only enhance hydrogen evolution over-potential of zinc anode but affect the zinc growth mechanism. As a consequence, an excellent cyclic performances upto 100 cycles (capacity retention: 90%) with high reversible capacities are achieved for the zinc anode with AESI. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen (H2) is a clean energy carrier which can help to solve environmental issues with the depletion of fossil fuels. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a promising candidate material for solid state hydrogen storage due to its huge hydrogen storage capacity and nontoxicity. However, the hydrolysis of NaBH4 usually requires expensive noble metal catalysts for a high H2 generation rate (HGR). Here, we synthesized high-aspect ratio copper nanowires (CuNWs) using a hydrothermal method and used them as the catalyst for the hydrolysis of NaBH4 to produce H2. The catalytic H2 generation demonstrated that 0.1 ng of CuNWs could achieve the highest volume of H2 gas in 240 min. The as-prepared CuNWs exhibited remarkable catalytic performance: the HGR of this study (2.7 × 1010 mL min−1 g−1) is ~3.27 × 107 times higher than a previous study on a Cu-based catalyst. Furthermore, a low activation energy (Ea) of 42.48 kJ mol−1 was calculated. Next, the retreated CuNWs showed an outstanding and stable performance for five consecutive cycles. Moreover, consistent catalytic activity was observed when the same CuNWs strip was used for four consecutive weeks. Based on the results obtained, we have shown that CuNWs can be a plausible candidate for the replacement of a costly catalyst for H2 generation. © 2020 by the authors.

 Abstract:  High-temperature polymer dielectrics are in great demand for harsh-environment applications. Maintaining high-energy storage density and low loss at elevated temperatures remains a major challenge for polymer dielectrics. In this work, a new type of polymer dielectric material is designed, which exhibits comparable dielectric properties in the start-of-the-art dielectric nanocomposites and a superior potential for scale up. A soluble, glassy state polymer with a polarizing group is designed by introducing a weakly polar group into the polyaramid (PA) backbone to dilute the hydrogen bonding of the PA parent species. This increases the mobility of the molecular dipole within the polymer in the glassy state, thereby increasing its dielectric constant while maintaining the high-temperature performance. The result of this design is a polymer with a glass transition temperature of 251 °C, a dielectric constant of up to 4.5, and a dielectric loss of 1%, while maintaining 2.1 J cm−3 energy density and 86.8% efficiency at 200 °C. This polymer, with its excellent, intrinsic, electrical-energy-storage properties can also be adapted for a roll-to-roll capacitor film production. Breaking intermolecular hydrogen bonds to enhance the electrical-energy-storage properties of polymers is an excellent path for designing polymer dielectrics with high-temperature capabilities. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

 Abstract:  Exploring electrolytes of high safety is essential to pave the practical route for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) toward their important applications in large-scale energy storage and power supplies. In this regard, ionogel electrolytes (IEs) have been highlighted owing to their high ionic conductivity, prominent electrochemical and thermal stability, and, more crucially, high interfacial wettability. However, present studies lack an understanding of the interaction of IEs, which determines the ion desolvation and migration. In this article, IEs comprising an SBA-15 host, an ionic liquid, sodium salt, and poly(vinylidene fluoride)-hexafluoro propylene (PVDF-HFP) have been proposed by mechanical ball milling and roller pressing. The component ratio has been optimized based on the balance between ionic conductivity and self-supporting capability of IEs. The optimal IEs showed sufficiently high ionic conductivity (2.48 × 10-3 S cm-1 at 30 °C), wide electrochemical window (up to 4.8 V vs Na+/Na), and high Na+ transference number (0.37). Due to the presence of SBA-15 and an ionic liquid, the IEs exhibited much improved thermal resistance than that of the conventional organic liquid electrolytes (OLEs). Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy revealed the hydrogen bonding interaction between silanols and the dissolved salts, not only anchoring anions for immobilization but also promoting the dissociation of sodium salts. After being matched with the Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode and metallic Na anode, the SIBs presented a specific discharge capacity of up to 110.7 mA h g-1 initially at room temperature with 92% capacity retention after 300 cycles. The improved safety and electrochemical performance provided insights into rationally regulating IEs and their interactions with the prospect of strengthening their practical applications in SIBs. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Here, we demonstrate a quasi-solid-state template strategy to synthesis highly dispersed supported metal catalysts on nitrogen-doped carbon (M-N-C) with a large fraction of single atom Ni species, in which dispersion of metal precursor, evaporation of solvent and downsizing of templates can be simultaneously achieved during the one-step ball-milling process. The incorporation of such nickel-based catalysts into MgH2 greatly improved the kinetics with the reduced activation energy of 87.2 ± 5.4 kJ mol−1 (156.5 ± 3.2 kJ mol−1 for blank).

 Abstract:  Solid-state composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) usually suffer from intrinsic low ionic conductivity and a solid-solid interface, badly inhibiting their widespread commercial application in all-solid-state Li-metal battery (ASSLMB) energy storage. Herein, a synergetic strategy using strong Lewis acid-base and weak hydrogen bonds was employed for self-assembly in situ construction of three-dimensional (3D) network-structured poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and SiO2 CPEs (PEO@SiO2). Ascribed to this synergistically rigid-flexible coupling dynamic strategy, a harmonious incorporation of monodispersed SiO2 nanoparticles into PEO could remarkably reduce crystallinity of PEO, significantly enhancing the ionic conductivity (∼1.1 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 30 °C) and dramatically facilitating solid electrolyte interface stabilization (electrochemical stability window > 4.8 V at 90 °C). Moreover, the PEO@SiO2-based ASSLMBs possess excellent rate capability over a wide temperature range (∼105 mA h g-1 under 2 C at 90 °C), high temperature cycling capacity (retaining 90 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 90 °C), and high specific capacity (146 mA h g-1 under 0.3 C at 90 °C).

 Abstract:  Reversible hydrogen uptake and the metal/dielectric transition make the Mg/MgH2 system a prime candidate for solid-state hydrogen storage and dynamic plasmonics. However, high dehydrogenation temperatures and slow dehydrogenation hamper broad applicability. One promising strategy to improve dehydrogenation is the formation of metastable γ-MgH2. A nanoparticle (NP) design, where γ-MgH2 forms intrinsically during hydrogenation is presented and a formation mechanism based on transmission electron microscopy results is proposed. Volume expansion during hydrogenation causes compressive stress within the confined, anisotropic NPs, leading to plastic deformation of β-MgH2 via (301)β twinning. It is proposed that these twins nucleate γ-MgH2 nanolamellas, which are stabilized by residual compressive stress. Understanding this mechanism is a crucial step toward cycle-stable, Mg-based dynamic plasmonic and hydrogen-storage materials with improved dehydrogenation. It is envisioned that a more general design of confined NPs utilizes the inherent volume expansion to reform γ-MgH2 during each rehydrogenation. © 2021 The Authors.

 Abstract:  Fuel cell vehicles powered by hydrogen are particularly attractive and competitive among rapidly developing new energy-driven automobiles. One critical problem for this type of vehicles is the high cost for hydrogen storage due to the lack of efficient and low-pressure hydrogen storage technologies. In the frame of development of hydrogen physisorption-relied materials, attention has mostly been paid to the textural designs of porous materials, including specific surface area, pore volume, and pore size. However, based on the hydrogen physisorption mechanism, hydrogen adsorption energy on a material surface is another key factor with regard to hydrogen uptake capacity.

 Abstract:  The design of multinary solid-state material systems that undergo reversible phase changes via changes in temperature and pressure provides a potential means of safely storing hydrogen. However, fully mapping the stabilities of known or newly targeted compounds relative to competing phases at reaction conditions has previously required many stringent experiments or computationally demanding calculations of each compound's change in Gibbs energy with respect to temperature, G(T). In this work, we have extended the approach of constructing chemical potential phase diagrams based on ΔGf(T) to enable the analysis of phase stability at non-zero temperatures. We first performed density functional theory calculations to compute the formation enthalpies of binary, ternary, and quaternary compounds within several compositional spaces of current interest for solid-state hydrogen storage. Temperature effects on solid compound stability were then accounted for using our recently introduced machine learned descriptor for the temperaturedependent contribution Gδ(T) to the Gibbs energy G(T). From these Gibbs energies, we evaluated each compound's stability relative to competing compounds over a wide range of conditions and show using chemical potential and composition phase diagrams that the predicted stable phases and H2 release reactions are consistent with experimental observations. This demonstrates that our approach rapidly computes the thermochemistry of hydrogen release reactions for compounds at sufficiently high accuracy relative to experiment to provide a powerful framework for analyzing hydrogen storage materials. This framework based on G(T) enables the accelerated discovery of active materials for a variety of technologies that rely on solid-state reactions involving these materials.  © 2020 American Chemical Society.

Carboxyl and carbonyl have been proven to significantly enhance the aqueous electrolyte wettability, Zn-ion chemical adsorption, and pseudocapacitive redox activity by experimental study and computational analysis. The rGO cathode produced through hydrogen peroxide assisted hydrothermal reduction exhibits a specific capacitance of 277 F g−1 in 1 m ZnSO4 after optimization of surface oxygen functional groups. In addition, a quasi-solid-state flexible Zn-ion hybrid capacitor (ZHC) with a polyacrylamide gel electrolyte and a high loading mass of 5.1 mg cm−2 are assembled. The as-prepared quasi-solid state ZHC can offer a superior areal capacitance of 1257 mF cm−2 and distinguished areal energy density of 342 µW h cm−2. The significant enhancement of redox activity and Zn-ion storage capability by regulating the oxygen functional groups can shed light on the promotion of electrochemical charge storage properties even beyond protic electrolyte systems. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH

 Abstract:  In an effort to realize a sustainable hydrogen economy, we are facing the demanding and challenging issue of providing compact and safe storage solutions for hydrogen in solid-state materials. Studies on the hydrogen storage properties of materials generally involve their phase structures, microstructures, thermal/structural stability, chemical compositions and bonding, which can be studied by ex situ experimental technologies. However, the experimental results obtained from ex situ measurements may be contaminated during sample handling, and some important intermediate phases are too metastable/unstable to be detected. To overcome the drawbacks, in situ studies are carried out, leading to a large number of unprecedented advantages. In this review, recent advances regarding in situ measurement technologies for solid-state hydrogen storage materials are summarized, mainly focusing on metal hydrides and complex hydrides. The working principles together with the devices used for the in situ methods are briefly introduced. Afterwards, both the classic and recent advances regarding the in situ measurement technologies for metal hydrides and complex hydrides are comprehensively summarized and reviewed. In addition to highlighting the tremendous merits of the in situ methods and the relevant achievements in the field of hydrogen storage materials, the remaining challenges and trends of the emerging research are also discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

 Abstract:  Uranium hydride is commonly used to store hydrogen or its isotopes in a solid state. The Self-Assaying Tritium Accountancy and Containment Unit for ITER (STACI) is a 5.2-kg bed of depleted uranium (dU) capable of holding up to 33 mol of hydrogen or its isotopes. This paper is a summary of data analysis of past experimental campaigns with STACI, with the aim of describing the kinetics and thermodynamics of the hydriding process. Computed tomography imaging was performed on STACI both before and after its experimental campaign, and a high degree of swelling was observed in the dU. Literature on studies in regard to the swelling of large (multikilogram) quantities of uranium hydride for storage applications was not identified during this study. Data from the experimental campaign, as well as data on the formation reaction, are presented.

 Abstract:  We introduce a facile chemical solid state method to in situ grow MgH2 nanoparticles in various carbon materials. Commercial carbon materials, containing coconut shell charcoal (CSC), multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT), graphite (G) and activated carbon (AC) are employed as the templates. The MgH2@X (X = CSC, CNT, G and AC) composites were successfully obtained by the simple solid state method. The hydrogen storage properties of MgH2@X (X = CSC, CNT, G and AC) composites are systematically studied by temperature-programmed desorption system, isothermal de/hydrogenation apparatus and differential scanning calorimetry measurements. Experimental results reveal that the MgH2@CSC composites have the most fascinating hydrogen absorption and desorption performance, followed by MgH2@CNT, MgH2@G and MgH2@AC composites. The dehydrogenation of MgH2@CSC composites begins at 245 °C. Moreover, the MgH2@CSC composites exhibit superior de/hydrogenation kinetic performance. The composites could desorb 5.4 wt% hydrogen within 10 min at 325 °C, and the dehydrogenated composites take up 5.0 wt% hydrogen within 5 min at 250 °C under 2 MPa H2 pressure. Among the carbon materials, CSC with layered structure composed of interconnected wrinkles is most beneficial to maintain the high dispersity and nano size of MgH2 nanoparticles, resulting in the superior de/hydrogenation performance. © 2020

 Abstract:  In this study, V1-xTixO2 oxide systems were synthesized with solid state reaction by using V2O5 and TiO2 at a temperature range of 600–1300 °C for the direct application of hydrogen storage materials for fuel cells. At a temperature of 1300 °C, two compositions, V0.1Ti0.9O2 (VT19) and V0.3Ti0.7O2 (VT37), were only synthesized as rutile TiO2 phase in V1-xTixO2 (x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) oxide systems. When Pt was impregnated on V1-xTixO2 oxide systems and heat-treated at 600 °C, VT19, VT37, and V0.5Ti0.5O2 (VT55) were synthesized into a single phase showing TiO2 rutile phase under reducing condition. Therefore, the incorporation of Pt into the V1-xTixO2 oxide powder by applying the impregnation method could effectively lower the synthesis condition of 1300–600 °C. From the XPS analysis, the concentration of V3+ was found to be highest in the reducing condition and the concentration of V4+ was the highest in the oxidation condition.

 Abstract:  Palladium hydride alloys are superconductors and hydrogen storage materials. One synthesis route is compression of Pd to high pressure in a hydrogen-rich environment. Here we report the evolution of the unit cell volume of PdHx synthesized by compressing Pd in a pure H2 medium to pressures from 0.2 to 8 GPa in a diamond anvil cell at room temperature. The volume of the face-centered cubic unit cell changes nonmonotonically with pressure, increasing upon compression from 0.2 to 1 GPa and decreasing upon compression from 1 to 8 GPa. Volume is reversible upon decompression and is independent of whether the sample was heated to 600 K at low pressure (P<2 GPa). The x-ray diffraction data show no evidence for a phase transition between 0.2 and 8 GPa. The volume maximum at 1 GPa must be caused by progressive hydrogenation from 0 to 1 GPa. Assuming a pressure-volume-composition equation of state derived from previously published data, the [H]:[Pd] ratio in this study increases to a maximum value of x=1±0.02 at 2±0.5 GPa and remains stable upon further compression to and from 8 GPa. These results add to a mounting body of evidence that PdH1±ϵ is in thermodynamic equilibrium with pure H2 at room temperature from 2 GPa to at least 8 GPa. The simplest interpretation is that H atoms occupy all octahedral sites and no tetrahedral sites in face-centered cubic PdH1.0. © 2021 American Physical Society.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen is an ideal candidate to fuel as “future energy needs”. Hydrogen is a light (Mw = 2.016 g mol−1), abundant, and nonpolluting gas. Hydrogen as a fuel can be a promising alternative to fossil fuels; i.e., it enables energy security and takes cares of climate change issue. Hydrogen has a low density of around 0.0899 kg m−3 at normal temperature, and pressure (~7% of the density of air), which is the main challenge in its real applications. It means, for example, 1 kg of hydrogen requires an extremely high volume of around 11 m3. In order to solve this limitation of hydrogen, solid-state hydrogen storage materials are used to store hydrogen efficiently and effectively. In this chapter, an attempt has been developed to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in hydrogen storage materials in terms of capacity, content, efficiency, and mechanism of storage. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.

 Abstract:  Recycling of metallic solid-waste (SW) components has recently become one of the most attractive topics for scientific research and applications on a global scale. A considerable number of applications are proposed for utilizing metallic SW products in different applications. Utilization of SW magnesium (Mg) metal for tailoring high-hydrogen storage capacity nanoparticles has never been reported as yet. The present study demonstrates the ability to produce pure Mg ingots through a melting and casting approach from Mg-machining chips. The ingots were used as a feedstock material to produce high-quality Mg-ribbons, using a melting/casting and spinning approaches. The ribbons were then subjected to severe plastic deformation through the cold rolling technique. The as-cold roll Mg strips were then snipped into small shots before charging them into reactive ball milling. The milling process was undertaken under high-pressure of pure hydrogen gas (H2), where titanium balls were used as milling media. The final product obtained after 100 h of milling showcased excellent nanocrystalline structure and revealed high hydro/dehydrogenation kinetics at moderate temperature (275°C). The present study shows that primer cold rolling of Mg-strips before reactive ball milling is a necessary step to prepare ultrafine magnesium hydride (MgH2) nanopowders with advanced absorption/desorption kinetics behavior. These ultrafine powders with their nanocrystalline structure are believed to play an important role in effective gas diffusion process. Moreover, the fine titanium particles came from the ball-powder-ball collisions and introduced to the Mg matrix have not only acted as micro-scaled milling media, but they played a vital catalyzation role for the process. © 2020 by the authors.

 Abstract:  Due to their fuel flexibility and high efficiency, solid oxide cells are a promising technology for sustainable energy production and storage. Nickel in combination with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) or gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC), forming Ni-YSZ or Ni-GDC cermets respectively, are the most widely adopted electrodes in solid oxide fuel cell fabrication. Currently, there is an increasing interest in cermet electrodes for hydrogen generation through high temperature steam electrolysis using solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs). However, durability remains a major issue for reliable operation of SOEC systems. A variety of processes accountable for permanent performance degradation of SOECs has been identified based on post-mortem cell analysis. Besides, transient/reversible degradation processes are typically examined by indirect methods, like impedance spectroscopy. The reason is that the application of material characterization techniques during SOEC operational conditions is challenging. In this work we provide a direct correlation between Ni-YSZ and Ni-GDC electrode surface oxidation states and their performance during steam electrolysis using operando experimental evidence provided by near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. We show that nickel surface oxidation may induce significant performance degradation in Ni-YSZ cathodes while, on the contrary, having minor effects in Ni-GDC. Remarkably, we found that in the case of Ni-GDC electrodes, small modification of the GDC oxidation state can have an important impact on the electrolysis performance. The results highlight the crucial role of the cathode electrode surface oxidation state on the SOEC functionality and have potential implications for the design and operation strategies of more efficient and durable SOEC devices. ©opyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  NaMgH3 has been considered to be a potential candidate for solid-state hydrogen storage due to its considerable hydrogen gravimetric (6.0 wt %) and volumetric (88.0 g/L) densities. Meanwhile, NaMgH3 possesses an outstanding theoretical thermal storage density of 2881 kJ/kg, which makes it one of the most promising thermal energy storage materials. However, the sluggish dehydrogenation kinetics of NaMgH3 embarrasses further practical application. Doping a nanosize Ti-based catalyst is treated to be one of the most effective methods to settle the poor dehydriding kinetics. In this work, different kinds of TiO2 catalysts, the 5 wt % TiO2 microparticle (MP) (100 nm), TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) (5-10 nm), and TiO2 nanotube (NT) (5-10 nm), were doped into NaMgH3 in the process of ball milling and heat treatment, which in situ formed Na0.46TiO2 significantly promoting the full hydrogen desorption kinetics of NaMgH3. Among all samples, the TiO2 NT-doped sample shows the best performance of which the onset decomposition temperature is reduced to 300 °C, and the first- and second-step decomposition peak temperatures are decreased to 346.3 and 355.8 °C, respectively. The TiO2 NT-doped sample desorbs approximately 3.4 wt % H2 at 350 °C within 10 min, while the pure NaMgH3 sample releases only 0.2 wt % H2 in 10 min. The significant improvement in both two decomposition reactions kinetics of NaMgH3 can be attributed to the tubular morphology of the TiO2 NT and the in situ formation of multivalence Ti species (Na0.46TiO2). These two reasons can change the kinetic models of NaMgH3 from A2 to R2 and further dramatically decrease the activation energies of first- and second-step decomposition reactions of NaMgH3 to 91.7 and 142.1 kJ/mol, respectively. In particular, the in situ formed Na0.46TiO2 can benefit the e- transfers among Na+, Mg2+, and H-, tremendously enhancing dehydrogenation properties. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Non-destructive, controllable, remote light-induced release inside cells enables studying of time- and space-specific surface-mediated delivery of bioactive compounds, which is an important approach in a wide range of biomedical tasks, especially those related to the control of cell growth, regenerative medicine, and self-disinfecting structures such as catheters. In this regard, the elaboration of encapsulation and controlled release of oxidative species is in high demand due to its versatile applications. One of the obvious candidates for such species is hydrogen peroxide. However, the delivery of hydrogen peroxide to the site of interest with high temporal and spatial precision remains challenging due to the active and unstable nature of the substance. We hereby present an approach to encapsulate and store a hydrogen peroxide-containing solid compound (sodium percarbonate) in the free-standing arrays of biopolymer-based microchambers. In this regard, we use solid-state encapsulation enabling high payload ability, followed by isolated storage in order to prevent contact of the cargo with water. Monitoring of the release profiles reveals the encapsulation of sodium percarbonate with little leakage for up to 24 hours. Microchambers are fabricated with predetermined size and spatial distribution, which allows the release of extremely small amounts of cargo (10-30 pg) with high spatial accuracy. Microchambers are made of polylactic acid and functionalized by carbon nanodots, which provide biocompatibility and biodegradability of the whole system together with responsiveness towards NIR light. These chambers facilitate both ultrasound-assisted burst release and laser-driven carbon nanoparticle-assisted precise release of extremely small, controlled amounts of a few picograms of hydrogen peroxide in submerged conditions. Microchambers loaded with sodium percarbonate provided adhesion and high viability of mouse fibroblasts over 24 h of exposure.

 Abstract:  Ammonia is a promising hydrogen storage medium; however, its decomposition via conventional thermal catalysis requires a significant amount of thermal energy input in order to overcome the reaction barriers. Here, we use embedded correlated wavefunction (ECW) theory to quantify reaction pathways and energetics for ammonia decomposition (N-H bond dissociation and N2 and H2 associative desorption) on copper (Cu) nanoparticles using a Cu (111) surface model. We predict that surface plasmon excitations will be able to facilitate ammonia decomposition by substantially reducing the effective barriers along excited-state pathways. We estimate the reductions in reaction barriers for breaking the first N-H bond and for recombinative desorption of surface-bound nitrogen and hydrogen atoms to be approximately 1.7, 0.8, and 0.5 eV, respectively. Further, by using the experimental N2 desorption barrier as a reference, we compare the accuracy of various theoretical methods, including plane-wave Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations with commonly used exchange-correlation functionals, embedded complete active space second-order perturbation theory, and embedded multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory. This work offers further confirmation that the ECW theoretical framework is the most robust for treating highly correlated local electronic structures of solids. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  The dehydrogenation reaction pathway and rate-limiting step of a nano-LiBH4 + nano-MgH2 mixture with a 0.5:1 molar ratio, which has been shown to have the ability to reversibly release and absorb ∼5.7 wt% H2 at 265 °C, have been investigated in detail. The study reveals that the solid-state dehydrogenation kinetics of the MgH2 + 0.5 LiBH4 mixture at 265 °C is nucleation-and-growth controlled. The rate-limiting step for dehydrogenation via the two parallel reaction pathways has been identified through examination of the elementary reactions as the nucleation and growth of reaction products LiH and MgB2. The interfacial area between MgH2 and LiBH4 plays a critical role in the nucleation and growth of LiH and MgB2, and thus influence the dehydrogenation kinetics and H2 storage capacity of the MgH2 + 0.5 LiBH4 mixture. X-ray diffraction, SEM analysis and specific surface area measurements reveal that the evolution of the powder characteristics before and after isothermal hydrogen uptake/release cycles is consistent with the kinetics observation and analysis. This study indicates that to further improve the dehydrogenation kinetics of the MgH2 + LiBH4 mixture, the nucleation and growth rates of LiH and/or MgB2 should be enhanced in the future, while the interfacial area between MgH2 and LiBH4 should be increased and maintained to be as large as possible during hydrogen uptake/release cycles. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  The use of alternative energy sources in various areas of industry and in everyday life is becoming increasingly important. This is due to the depletion of the sources of hydrocarbon raw materials and, at the same time, the use of fossil fuel leads to environmental degradation and environmental pollution. Among the various possible sources of renewable energy, solar and hydrogen energies are considered the most promising. The main obstacle to widespread use and distribution of them is the lack of materials, which can effectively convert the energy of Sun and hydrogen into electricity and heat. The main requirements for such materials are the high-energy capacity, structural stability, and low price. These properties are inherent in nanocrystalline materials and, therefore, many studies of recent decades have been devoted to them. In this review, a special attention is focused on the three types of nanocrystalline objects of greatest interest for power engineering, namely, solar cells, lithium-ion batteries and solid-state hydrogen storage. Their structural features, manufacturing techniques as well as the relationship between structure and energy capacity are considered.

 Abstract:  Spark plasma sintered transition metal diborides such as HfB2, ZrB2 and their solid solutions were investigated as electrode materials for electrochemical hydrogen evolutions reactions (HER) in 1 M H2SO4 and 1 M NaOH electrolytes. HfB2 and ZrB2 formed complete solid solutions when mixed in 1:1, 1:4, and 4:1 ratios and they were stable in both electrolytes. The HER kinetics of the diborides were slower in the basic solution than in the acidic solutions. The Tafel slopes in 1 M H2SO4 were in the range of 0.15–0.18 V/decade except for pure HfB2 which showed a Tafel slope of 0.38 V/decade. In 1 M NaOH the Tafel slopes were in the range of 0.12–0.27 V/decade. The composition of HfxZr1−xB2 solid solutions with x=0.2–0.8, influenced the exchange current densities, overpotentials and Tafel slopes of the HER. The EIS data were fitted with a porous film equivalent circuit model in order to better understand the HER behavior. In addition, modeling calculations, using density functional theory approach, were carried out to estimate the density of states and band structure of the boride solid solutions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Zinc-air batteries and full water-splitting devices, as environmentally friendly electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems, have drawn extensive attention. However, effective, low-cost and durable electrochemical catalysts for the involved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are highly desired. Herein, a new N, B co-doped Co3C multifunctional catalyst with enhanced ORR, OER and HER activities, as well as improved ORR and OER stabilities, in alkaline media has been synthesized. The strategy used, immersing N-doped Co3C in NaBH4 solution, not only achieves N, B co-doping via the N anchoring effect to B at room temperature for the first time, but also engineers the outmost surface of Co3C-N by forming nanosheet arrays. Besides, Co-Nx-B and N-B bonds have been successful produced via the anchoring effect of N during the immersion treatment, which is proved by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results. In particular, both liquid and solid-state Zn-air batteries that are equipped with Co3C-NB as air-cathodes all exhibit superior cycling stabilities over those with Co3C, N-doped Co3C and Pt/C + IrO2 air-cathodes. Furthermore, a Co3C-NB-based full water splitting device can be successfully driven using two solid-state zinc-air batteries with a Co3C-NB air-cathode in series. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  5-Fluorocytosine or flucytosine (FLC) is a well-known drug for anti-fungal treatment and is one of the essential medicines needed in a health system. The main disadvantage of FLC drugs is their instability due to hydration under storage conditions. In the present work, cocrystal/salt screening experiments resulted in three molecular salts of FLC with dihydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3HBA), 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,5HBA), and 2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,6HBA), and two cocrystals with gallic acid (GAA) and glutaric acid (GLA). Since FLC drugs are highly susceptible to hydration, the present work concentrated on the stability of the synthesized molecular salts/cocrystals under different relative humidity (RH) conditions. All the newly formed crystalline adducts were characterized structurally, and the crystal structures were determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction techniques (SCXRD). The FLC-2,6HBA salt was found to be a monohydrate, whereas the FLC-3,5HBA salt was crystallized as a hemipentahydrate. FLC-2,3HBA and FLC-GLA were crystallized in 2:1 equimolar ratios of FLC and the coformer. The FLC-GAA cocrystal crystallized in a 1:1 equimolar ratio. Two point heterosynthons between FLC and the coformer were observed in all the crystalline structures except FLC-GLA, where the structure was formed through a single point heterosynthon. Stability studies under different relative humidity conditions showed the non-hygroscopicity of the synthesized molecular salts/cocrystals. It was found that the FLC-2,3HBA salt, and the FLC-GAA and FLC-GLA cocrystals did not experience any hydration under the accelerated humidity conditions (both 70-75% RH and 90-95% RH) at ambient temperature (∼30 °C). However, FLC-2,6HBA and FLC-3,5HBA were found to be hygroscopic under 70-75% RH conditions. Furthermore, all the synthesized salts/cocrystals except FLC-3,5HBA were found to be stable for 2 months under ambient conditions (∼30 °C, 60-65% RH). Therefore, the FLC-2,3HBA salt, and the FLC-GAA and FLC-GLA cocrystals are better candidates for the preparation of new drug products of FLC. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

 Abstract:  Hydrazine borane (N2H4BH3, 15.4 wt% H) has been considered as a highly promising hydrogen storage material because of its inherent advantages such as high hydrogen content and high stability in the solid state. However, the practical application of N2H4BH3 for the generation of hydrogen is strongly inhibited by the need for expensive noble metal-based catalysts. To overcome this challenge, noble-metal-free CuNiMo nanocatalysts were prepared using a facile chemical reduction approach under an ambient atmosphere at room temperature. Unexpectedly, the resultant CuNiMo catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity, and 100% H2 selectivity toward hydrogen generation from N2H4BH3via its BH3 group hydrolysis and N2H4 moiety decomposition at 323 K. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a noble-metal-free catalyst achieving a complete conversion of N2H4BH3 to H2. In addition, CuNiMo can achieve a complete dehydrogenation of hydrous hydrazine (N2H4·H2O). The excellent catalytic performance of the Cu0.4Ni0.6Mo catalyst may be attributed to the electronic modification among Cu, Ni and Mo, and may also be related to the strong basic sites of Cu0.4Ni0.6Mo. The present simple, low cost, highly efficient, and highly selective catalyst may promote the practical application of N2H4BH3 as an effective hydrogen storage material. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  We have investigated the structure and hydrogen storage properties of a series of quaternary and quintary high-entropy alloys related to the ternary system TiVNb with powder X-ray diffraction (PXD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and manometric measurements in a Sieverts apparatus. The alloys have body-centred cubic (bcc) crystal structures and form face-centred cubic (fcc) metal hydrides with hydrogen-to-metal ratios close to 2 by hydrogenation. The onset temperature for hydrogen desorption, Tonset, decreases linearly with the valence-electron concentration, VEC. Moreover, the volumetric expansion per metal atom from the bcc alloys to the fcc hydrides, [(V/Z)fcc−(V/Z)bcc]/(V/Z)bcc, increases linearly with the VEC. Therefore, it seems that a larger expansion of the lattice destabilizes the metal hydrides and that this effect can be tuned by altering the VEC. Kissinger analyses performed on the DSC measurements indicate that the destabilization is a thermodynamic rather than kinetic effect. Based upon these insights we have identified TiVCrNbH8 as a material with suitable thermodynamics for hydrogen storage in the solid state. This HEA-based hydride has a reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 1.96 wt% H at room temperature and moderate H2-pressures. Moreover, it is not dependent on any elaborate activation procedure to absorb hydrogen. © 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

 Abstract:  Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is an attractive hydrogen carrier owing to its reactivity with water: it can generate 4 equivalents of H2 by hydrolysis (NaBH4 + 4H2O → NaB(OH)4 + 4H2). Since using NaBH4 in the solid state is the most favorable way to achieve a high gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity (theoretical maximum of 7.3 wt%), we have investigated the possibility of developing a core@shell nanocomposite (NaBH4@Ni) where a metallic nickel catalyst facilitating the hydrolysis is directly supported onto NaBH4 nanoparticles. Following our initial work on core-shell hydrides, the successful preparation of NaBH4@Ni has been confirmed by TEM, EDS, IR, XRD and XPS. During hydrolysis, the intimately combined Ni0 and NaBH4 allow the production of H2 at high rates (e.g. 6.1 L min-1 g-1 at 39 °C) when water is used in excess. After H2 generation, the spent fuel is composed of an aqueous solution of NaB(OH)4 and a nickel-based agglomerated material in the form of Ni(OH)2 as evidenced by TEM, XPS and XRD. The effective gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity of nanosized NaBH4@Ni has been optimized by adjusting the required amount of water for hydrolysis and an effective hydrogen capacity of 4.4 wt% has been achieved. This is among the best reported values. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Nanometer-sized structures, surfaces and sub-surface phenomena have played an enormous role in science and technological applications and represent a driving-force of current interdisciplinary science. Recent developments include the atomic-scale characterization of nanoparticles, molecular reactions at surfaces, magnetism at the atomic scale, photoelectric characterization of nanostructures as well as two-dimensional solids. Research and development of smart nanostructured materials governed by their surface properties is a rapidly growing field. The main challenge is to develop an accurate and robust electronic structure description. The density of surface-related trap states is analyzed by transient UV photoconductivity and temperature-dependent admittance spectroscopy. An advanced application of thin films on shaped substrates is the deposition of catalytic layers on hollow glass microspheres for hydrogen storage controlled exothermal hydrolytic release. Surface properties of thin films including dissolution and corrosion, fouling resistance, and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity are explored to improve materials response in biological environments and medicine. Trends in surface biofunctionalization routes based on vacuum techniques, together with advances in surface analysis of biomaterials, are discussed. Pioneering advances in the application of X-ray nanodiffraction of thin film cross-sections for characterizing nanostructure and local strain including in-situ experiments during nanoindentation are described. Precise measurements and control of plasma properties are important for fundamental investigations and the development of next generation plasma-based technologies. Critical control parameters are the flux and energy distribution of incident ions at reactive surfaces; it is also crucial to control the dynamics of electrons initiating non-equilibrium chemical reactions. The most promising approach involves the exploitation of complementary advantages in direct measurements combined with specifically designed numerical simulations. Exciting new developments in vacuum science and technology have focused on forward-looking and next generation standards and sensors that take advantage of photonics based measurements. These measurements are inherently fast, frequency based, easily transferrable to sensors based on photonics and hold promise of being disruptive and transformative. Realization of Pascal, the SI unit for pressure, a cold-atom trap based ultra-high and extreme high vacuum (UHV and XHV) standard, dynamic pressure measurements and a photonic based thermometer are three key examples that are presented. © 2018

 Abstract:  Graphene-based materials show unique properties. These single layered materials consist of 2D structure of carbon atoms, belong to the strongest known materials, that are very mechanically flexible, optically transparent and that are excellent electrical and thermal conductors. Recently, several studies on these types of materials have highlighted the potential of this material for hydrogen storage (HS) and raised new hopes for the development of an effective solid-state HS media. In the present paper, the structure and HS properties of graphene oxide (GO) and chemically reduced graphene oxide (rGO) produced by different procedures were studied. Hydrogen sorption characteristics of GO and rGO were measured using the Sieverts-type gas sorption analyzer PCT-Pro Setaram Instrumentation. The study of HS was carried out at temperature range from 198 K to 423 K under hydrogen pressure from 1x10-4 to 4 MPa. For the HS point of view, the advantage of GO or rGO compared to graphene, is the presence of multiple chemical groups that can be used for introducing modifiers and their superior spreading on the materials surface.

 Abstract:  The use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for the structural characterization of many nanostructured hydrides, which are relevant for solid state hydrogen storage, is hindered due to a rapid decomposition of the specimen upon irradiation with the electron beam. Environmental TEM allows to stabilize the hydrides by applying a hydrogen back pressure of up to 4.5 bar in a windowed environmental cell. The feasibility of high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) investigations of light weight metals and metal hydrides in such a “nanoreactor” is studied theoretically by means of multislice HRTEM contrast simulations using Mg and its hydride phase, MgH2, as model system. Such a setup provides the general opportunity to study dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions at the nanoscale under technological application conditions. We analyze the dependence of both the spatial resolution and the HRTEM image contrast on parameters such as the defocus, the metal/hydride thickness, and the hydrogen pressure in order to explore the possibilities and limitations of in-situ experiments with windowed environmental cells. Such simulations may be highly valuable to pre-evaluate future experimental studies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  The gelation property of the iron(iii) complex of 4-biphenylcarboxy capped diphenylalanine (l-Phe-l-Phe, the hydrophobic core motif of Alzheimer's β-amyloid polypeptide) has been reported. Gelation was observed selectively for FeCl3 and 4-biphenylcarboxy capped diphenylalanine, whereas Cd, Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni, Hg, Mg, Mn, Pb, and Pd complexes were not able to form a metallogel. However, Boc and acetyl capped diphenylalanine have failed to form a metallogel. The storage modulus of the metallogel was approximately an order of magnitude larger than the loss modulus, which indicates the elastic nature of the gel and the physical crosslink. The metallogel exhibits an entangled fiber network which is stabilized by weak interactions such as coordination, hydrogen bonding and π-π interactions. The solid-state study shows that the acetyl protected diphenylalanine adopts an extended conformation and forms a supramolecular helix-like structure through multiple intermolecular hydrogen bonds. However, the 4-biphenylcarboxy protected diphenylalanine shows a supramolecular sheet-like structure through intermolecular hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking interactions between the biphenyl moieties. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Solid-state hydride compounds are a promising option for efficient and safe hydrogen-storage systems. Lithium reactive hydride composite system 2LiBH4 + MgH2/2LiH + MgB2 (Li-RHC) has been widely investigated owing to its high theoretical hydrogen-storage capacity and low calculated reaction enthalpy (11.5 wt % H2 and 45.9 kJ/mol H2). In this paper, a thorough investigation into the effect of the formation of nano-TiAl alloys on the hydrogen-storage properties of Li-RHC is presented. The additive 3TiCl3·AlCl3 is used as the nanoparticle precursor. For the investigated temperatures and hydrogen pressures, the addition of ∼5 wt % 3TiCl3·AlCl3 leads to hydrogenation/dehydrogenation times of only 30 min and a reversible hydrogen-storage capacity of 9.5 wt %. The material containing 3TiCl3·AlCl3 possesses superior hydrogen-storage properties in terms of rates and a stable hydrogen capacity during several hydrogenation/dehydrogenation cycles. These enhancements are attributed to an in situ nanostructure and a hexagonal AlTi3 phase observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. This phase acts in a 2-fold manner, first promoting the nucleation of MgB2 upon dehydrogenation and second suppressing the formation of Li2B12H12 upon hydrogenation/dehydrogenation cycling. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:                               Solid-state metal hydrides are prime candidates to replace compressed hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles due to their high volumetric capacities. Sodium aluminum hydride has long been studied as an archetype for higher-capacity metal hydrides, with improved reversibility demonstrated through the addition of titanium catalysts; however, atomistic mechanisms for surface processes, including hydrogen desorption, are still uncertain. Here, operando and ex situ measurements from a suite of diagnostic tools probing multiple length scales are combined with ab initio simulations to provide a detailed and unbiased view of the evolution of the surface chemistry during hydrogen release. In contrast to some previously proposed mechanisms, the titanium dopant does not directly facilitate desorption at the surface. Instead, oxidized surface species, even on well-protected NaAlH                             4                              samples, evolve during dehydrogenation to form surface hydroxides with differing levels of hydrogen saturation. Additionally, the presence of these oxidized species leads to considerably lower computed barriers for H                             2                              formation compared to pristine hydride surfaces, suggesting that oxygen may actively participate in hydrogen release, rather than merely inhibiting diffusion as is commonly presumed. These results demonstrate how close experiment-theory feedback can elucidate mechanistic understanding of complex metal hydride chemistry and potentially impactful roles of unavoidable surface impurities.                          © 2019 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Herein, we report a new type of azobenzene-based unsymmetrical bent-core molecules exhibiting photoswitchability in the liquid crystalline state, solid state, and solution state and in mixture upon UV irradiation and intense visible light. The compounds exhibited solid-state photochromism upon exposure to UV light, whereas in liquid crystalline state, reversible phase transitions were observed via both UV irradiation and intense visible light exposure. Crystal structure analysis reveals the basic structural understanding such as nonplanar bent molecular shape, antiparallel arrangement of the polar bent molecules, intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding, and different π-πinteractions and interdigitation of long alkyl chains. The compounds are also found to act as supergelator toward various organic solvents. Hence, this is an excellent example of such potential bent-shaped liquid crystals that promise an immense perspective for device applications such as optical storage, molecular switches, etc. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Wide applications of compression-resistant electronics have promoted the demands for energy storage devices with high compressive strength. Herein, we fabricated highly dense graphene architectures (DGAs) embedded with solid electrolyte by evaporation-induced shrinkage of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hydrogels filled with phosphoric acid/polyvinyl alcohol (H3PO4/PVA) electrolyte solution. In such DGAs, rGO sheets remain a stacked structure and solid electrolyte is uniformly distributed throughout the DGAs, forming a good contact between rGO sheets and solid electrolyte by hydrogen bonding interactions. The DGAs exhibit a high weight density of 1.5 g cm−3, excellent modulus of 234 MPa and high conductivity of 13.5 S m−1. Furthermore, the all-solid-state supercapacitors based on DGAs achieved a superior volumetric capacitance of about 155 F cm−3 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1.

 Abstract:  LiBH4 is of particular interest as one of the most promising materials for solid-state hydrogen storage. Herein, LiBH4 is confined into a novel two-dimensional layered Ti3C2 MXene through a facile impregnation method for the first time to improve its hydrogen storage performance. The initial desorption temperature of LiBH4 is significantly reduced, and the de-/rehydrogenation kinetics are remarkably enhanced. It is found that the initial desorption temperature of LiBH4@2Ti3C2 hybrid decreases to 172.6 °C and releases 9.6 wt % hydrogen at 380 °C within 1 h, whereas pristine LiBH4 only releases 3.2 wt % hydrogen under identical conditions. More importantly, the dehydrogenated products can partially rehydrogenate at 300 °C and under 95 bar H2. The nanoconfined effect caused by unique layered structure of Ti3C2 can hinder the particles growth and agglomeration of LiBH4. Meanwhile, Ti3C2 could possess superior effect to destabilize LiBH4. The synergetic effect of destabilization and nanoconfinement contributes to the remarkably lowered desorption temperature and improved de-/rehydrogenation kinetics. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Conventional two-electrode water electrolyzers produce H2 accompanied by O2, and may suffer from gas mixing and high cell voltage inputs. Herein, we introduce a low-cost conducting polymer material polyaniline (PANI) as a solid-state redox mediator for decoupling the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. It allows these two half-reactions to be separated from each other in time during the electrolysis of water. As an intermediary material for charge storage, the PANI electrode exhibits a remarkable reversible discharge capacity of 125 mA h g-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1. Moreover, an approach by controlling the equilibrium potential of the PANI electrode is developed to balance the separate cell voltages. In this way, the decoupled HER and OER can be sequentially driven at close cell voltages of only 0.8 V. Considering the low cost of PANI and its excellent electrochemical performance, this study paves the way for the practical application of this state-of-the-art decoupling strategy. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Low temperature formation of Mg2FeH6 is demonstrated by hydrogenation of Mg-Fe elemental powder mixture at a temperature as low as 350 °C which is lower than the conventional process temperature, 500 °C.

 Abstract:  In addition to serving as an important energy carrier, hydrogen storage material also has the potential to be used as an effective solid reducing agent. This paper is concerned with the application of MgH2/MoS2 hydrogen storage materials to thiophene desulfurization through catalytic transfer hydrogenation. The hydrogen content of the as-prepared MgH2/MoS2 composites is determined to be 6.15 wt% with a dehydrogenation peak temperature of 402 °C. Taking MgH2 as hydrogen donor, thiophene hydrodesulfurization has taken place at atmospheric pressure and at the temperature lower than the onset desorption temperature, indicating that a coupling effect occurs between MgH2 decomposition and thiophene hydrogenation. It is further revealed that sulfur removal in thiophene under the studied condition preferentially proceeds via direct desulfurization (DDS) route. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations manifest that energy barriers of the minimum energy path for thiophene hydrodesulfurization are all <1.35 eV.

 Abstract:  Metal borohydrides (M(BH4)n, where n is the valence of metal M) have received considerable attention as promising hydrogen storage materials owing to their high hydrogen densities. In particular, the successful synthesis of rare-earth (RE) borohydrides free of solvates using mechanochemical milling and/or wet chemistry has promoted the study of these compounds as hydrogen storage materials and solid-state Li-ion conductors. Therefore, several RE borohydrides were discovered and characterized, and showed a rich chemistry with common structural characteristics and physical properties.

 Abstract:                               Voltage-gated ion transport as a means of manipulating magnetism electrically could enable ultralow-power memory, logic and sensor technologies.

However, elevated temperatures are required and chemical and structural changes lead to irreversibility and device degradation.

 Abstract:  Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) plays a crucial role in cell biochemistry, especially in metabolic pathways and energy storage. ADP itself, as well as many of its analogues, such as adenosine hypodiphosphate (AhDP), has been studied extensively, in particular in terms of enzymatic activity. However, structural studies in the solid state, especially for AhDP, are still missing. An analogue of ADP, i.e. adenosine hypodiphosphate ester, has been synthesized and characterized in the crystalline form as two hydrated sodium salts of 2′:3′-isopropylideneadenosine 5′-hypodiphosphate (H3AhDP, C13H19N5O9P2 for the neutral form), namely pentasodium tetrakis(2′:3′-isopropylideneadenosine 5′-hypodiphosphate) tetracosahydrate, 5Na+·3C13H18N5O9P2         −·C13H17N5O9P2         2−·24H2O or Na5(H2AhDP)3(HAhDP)·24H2O, (I), and sodium tetrakis(2′:3′-isopropylideneadenosine 5′-hypodiphosphate) pentadecahydrate, Na+·C13H20N5O9P2         +·2C13H18N5O9P2         −·C13H19N5O9P2·15H2O or Na(H4AhDP)(H3AhDP)(H2AhDP)2·15H2O, (II). Crystal structure analyses of (I) and (II) reveal two nucleoside hypodiphosphate ions in the asymmetric units with different ionization states of the hypodiphosphate unit and adenine base. For all AhDP nucleotides, the same anti conformation about the N-glycosidic bond and similar puckering of the ribose ring have been found. AhDP geometry and interactions have been compared to ADP nucleotides deposited in the Cambridge Structural Database.

 Abstract:  In order to identify potential hydrogen storage materials, worldwide attention has been focused on hydrides with high gravimetric and volumetric capacity. Hydrogen is a unique element that possesses positive, negative or neutral oxidation states in solids depending upon the chemical environment. If one can find hydrogen storage materials where hydrogen is present in both negative and positive oxidation states within the same structural framework then one can accommodate hydrogen with high volume density. So, it is fundamentally as well as technologically important to identify compounds in which hydrogen is amphoteric in nature and understand the necessary criteria for its origin. The experimental structural analysis of cyclotriborazane and diammonium dodeca hydro-closo-dodecaborate insinuates the presence of hydrogen with anionic and cationic behavior within the same structure. In order to understand the role of van der Waals (vdW) interactions on structural parameters, we have considered 12 different vdW corrected functionals and found that the optPBE-vdW functional predicts the equilibrium structural parameters reliably with less than 0.009% error. So, the optPBE-vdW functional is used to calculate charge density, electron localization function, total and partial density of states, Bader and Born effective charge, etc. We observed that hydrogen exhibits amphoteric behavior with H closer to B in a negatively charged state and that closer to N in a positively charged state. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  MgCo2 and MgNiCo crystallize with hexagonal Laves type intermetallic structures of the C14 type and do not form hydrides at ambient hydrogen pressures. However, applying high hydrogen pressures in the GPa range forces the hydrogen absorption and leads to the formation of multi-phase compositions, which contain approximately 2.5 atoms H per formula unit of MgCo2 or MgNiCo and remain thermally stable under normal conditions. The hydrogenation of MgCo2 resulted in its decomposition to a ternary Mg2CoD5 deuteride and metallic cobalt. Phase-structural transformations accompanying the vacuum desorption of deuterium in the temperature range of 27–500 °C were studied using in situ neutron powder diffraction. The investigation showed a complete recovery of the initial MgCo2 intermetallic via a Hydrogenation-Disproportionation-Desorption-Recombination process. At 300 °C, the Mg2CoD5 deuteride first decomposed to elementary Mg and hexagonal Co. At 400 °C, a MgCo phase was formed by interaction between Mg and Co. At the highest processing temperature of 500 °C, a solid-state interaction of MgCo and Co resulted in the recovery of the initial MgCo2. The interaction of MgNiCo with deuterium under the synthesis conditions of 2.8 GPa and 200 °C proceeded in a more complex way. A very stable ternary deuteride MgNi2D3 was leached away while Co was separated in the form of Mg2CoD5 and the remaining nickel formed a solid solution with Co with the approximate composition Ni0.7Co0.3. The thermal desorption of deuterium from MgCo2D2.5 and from MgNiCoD2.5 has been studied by Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy with deuterium released into a closed volume. The observed effects nicely correlate with changes in the phase structural composition of the hydrides formed. MgCo2 is a new example of the hydrogen storage alloy, in which a successful HDDR processing results in the reversible formation of the initial intermetallic at much lower temperatures than in the equilibrium phase diagram of the Mg-Co system. © 2017 Chinese Materials Research Society

 Abstract:  Titanium tetrafluoride (TiF4) plays a crucial role in prerestorative dentistry, the synthesis of metal fluorides and titanium silicate thin films, enhancing the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, and hydrogen storage applications. Though TiF4 is touted for superior catalytic activity in deflating the decomposition temperature of metal hydrides, its fundamental properties have not been studied yet. Compressibility is a vital parameter during mechanical milling and hydrogen cycling processes from solid metal hydrides to sustain its stability. Even though many high-pressure studies are available on metal hydrides, a similar study on the TiF4 additive has not yet been conducted by either theoretical or experimental methods. In an effort to identify the compressibility of the TiF4 catalyst, we have performed state-of-the-art density-functional-theory-based calculations for three chemical states of TiFx (x = 4, 3, and 2). The mechanical strength of a material is derived from interatomic interactions, which in turn are influenced by the microstructure and bonding. The results highlight the superior structural, electronic, mechanical, and optical properties of orthorhombic TiF4, which has octahedral columns similar to those of bone tissue material (hydroxyapatite). This article highlights the stable iono-covalent F-Ti-F bonding of the +4 state of titanium fluoride. Materials with Young's moduli close to that of bone (20-30 GPa) have been intensely searched for bone implants. TiF4 can be used for this purpose because its average Young's modulus is 47 GPa. Our detailed analysis of charge density in TiF4 sheds light on its unique bonding characteristics, which result in its extraordinary mechanical properties, making TiF4 a multifunctional material not only for dental fillings but also for orthopedic and catalytic applications.

 Abstract:  Here we report a phase transition in H2 adsorbed in a locally graphitic Saran carbon with subnanometer pores 0.5-0.65 nm in width, in which two layers of hydrogen can just barely squeeze, provided they pack tightly. The phase transition is observed at 75 K, temperatures far higher than other systems in which an adsorbent is known to increase phase transition temperatures: for instance, H2 melts at 14 K in the bulk, but at 20 K on graphite because the solid H2 is stabilized by the surface structure. Here we observe a transition at 75 K and 77-200 bar: from a low-temperature, low-density phase to a high-temperature, higher density phase. We model the low-density phase as a monolayer commensurate solid composed mostly of para-H2 (the ground nuclear spin state, S = 0) and the high-density phase as an orientationally ordered bilayer commensurate solid composed mostly of ortho-H2 (S = 1). We attribute the increase in density with temperature to the fact that the oblong ortho-H2 can pack more densely. The transition is observed using two experiments. The high-density phase is associated with an increase in neutron backscatter by a factor of 7.0 ± 0.1. Normally, hydrogen produces no backscatter (scattering angle >90°). This backscatter appears along with a discontinuous increase in the excitation mass from 1.2 amu to 21.0 ± 2.3 amu, which we associate with collective nuclear spin excitations in the orientationally ordered phase. Film densities were measured using hydrogen adsorption. No phase transition was observed in H2 adsorbed in control activated carbon materials. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Liquid organic hydrides, e.g. 9-ethylcarbazole, are potentially interesting hydrogen storage materials because of their reversible hydrogen sorption properties. In this study, the isobaric specific heat capacity of 9-ethylcarbazole in solid and liquid phases was investigated using adiabatic calorimeter.

 Abstract:  A series of novel silane-based hyper-cross-linked porous polymers was prepared through the Friedel–Crafts alkylation reaction of dimethyldiphenylsilane as the monomer and formaldehyde dimethyl acetal as the external cross-linker. The structures of the polymers were confirmed by FTIR and solid-state cross-polarization magic-angle spinning 13C NMR. We investigated the porous polymers with different ratios of dimethyldiphenylsilane to formaldehyde dimethyl acetal. Porous properties were determined by nitrogen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen adsorptions. The results revealed that the porous materials possessed surface areas from 742 to 1205 m2 g−1 with the increasing amount of formaldehyde dimethyl acetal. Moreover, this material exhibited high thermal stabilities, good CO2 capture, and H2 storage capacities. The material was also used as adsorbent for organic dyes in aqueous solution and showed an excellent adsorption capacity of 952 mg g−1 for Congo red dye. These results suggest that the silane-based hyper-cross-linked porous polymers are promising materials for CO2 capture, H2 storage, and water treatment. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

 Abstract:  The reactivity and thermal decomposition of γ-Mg(BH4)2-MHx, M = Li, Na, Mg, and Ca composites has been examined with the objective of studying the hydrogen storage capability of the composites. The samples were prepared by manual grinding γ-Mg(BH4)2 with a metal hydride to obtain homogenous mixtures. In-situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD) and simultaneous thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and mass spectrometry was performed to analyse the decomposition mechanism, whereas solid-state 11B nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and SR-PXD was used to investigate the decomposition products. Interestingly, substitution reactions take place between magnesium borohydride and lithium, sodium and calcium hydride forming the more stable metal borohydrides, M(BH4)x, M = Li, Na or Ca. The composite γ-Mg(BH4)2-LiH has a hydrogen release at T ∼380–420 °C, which indicates the formation of amorphous LiBH4 during decomposition. For the composites γ-Mg(BH4)2-NaH, formation of crystalline NaBH4 is observed by SR-PXD from T = 150–450 °C, and hydrogen release ascribed to NaBH4 is observed in MS data at T = 460–480 °C. γ-Mg(BH4)2-MgH2 composite decomposes as the individual constituents. β-Ca(BH4)2 is formed at T = 175–375 °C in the composites of γ-Mg(BH4)2-CaH2. Bragg diffraction from CaB6 at T > 370 °C is detected by SR-PXD for γ-Mg(BH4)2-CaH2 (1:0.5) but not for samples richer in CaH2.

 Abstract:                               2D metal-porphyrin frameworks (MPFs) are attractive for advanced energy storage devices. However, the inferior conductivity and low structural stability of MPFs seriously limit their application as flexible free-standing electrodes with high performance. Here, for the first time, an interlayer hydrogen-bonded MXene/MPFs film is proposed to overcome these disadvantages by intercalation of highly conductive MXene nanosheets into MPFs nanosheets via a vacuum-assisted filtration technology. The alternant insertion of MXene and MPFs affords 3D interconnected “MPFs-to-MXene-to-MPFs” conductive networks to accelerate the ionic/electronic transport rates. Meanwhile, the interlayer hydrogen bonds (F···HO and O···HO) contribute a high chemical stability due to a favorable tolerance to volume change caused by phase separation and structural collapse during the charge/discharge process. The synergistic effect makes MXene/MPFs film deliver a capacitance of 326.1 F g                             −1                              at 0.1 A g                             −1                             , 1.64 F cm                             −2                              at 1 mA cm                             −2                             , 694.2 F cm                             −3                              at 1 mA cm                             −3                              and a durability of about 30 000 cycles.

 Abstract:  LiBH4 is a promising material for hydrogen storage and as a solid-state electrolyte for Li ion batteries. Confining LiBH4 in porous scaffolds improves its hydrogen desorption kinetics, reversibility, and Li+ conductivity, but little is known about the influence of the chemical nature of the scaffold. Here, quasielastic neutron scattering and calorimetric measurements were used to study support effects for LiBH4 confined in nanoporous silica and carbon scaffolds. Pore radii were varied from 8 Å to 20 nm, with increasing confinement effects observed with decreasing pore size. For similar pore sizes, the confinement effects were more pronounced for silica than for carbon scaffolds. The shift in the solid-solid phase transition temperature is much larger in silica than in carbon scaffolds with similar pore sizes. A LiBH4 layer near the pore walls shows profoundly different phase behavior than crystalline LiBH4. This layer thickness was 1.94 ± 0.13 nm for the silica and 1.41 ± 0.16 nm for the carbon scaffolds. Quasi-elastic neutron scattering confirmed that the fraction of LiBH4 with high hydrogen mobility is larger for the silica than for the carbon nanoscaffold. These results clearly show that in addition to the pore size the chemical nature of the scaffold also plays a significant role in determining the hydrogen mobility and interfacial layer thickness in nanoconfined metal hydrides.

 Abstract:  Development of novel materials for water purification and storage is reliant on our understanding of the interaction of water within solid-state materials and inspired by the high selectivity present in certain biological systems. The present study investigates the influence of zwitterionic ligands on water properties within hybrid materials through the synthesis and characterization of four novel coordination polymers built from the uranyl unit and an imidazolium dicarboxylate (IMD) linker. One of the compounds (UIM-5) hosts an infinite water chain of edge sharing hexamers and octamers of hydrogen bonded water molecules. The other three compounds (UIM-2A, 2B, 2C) make up a polymorphic system in which the guest water molecules are found in varying degrees of isolation.

 Abstract:  To enhance the energy density of solid-state supercapacitors, a novel solid-state cell, made of redox-active poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel electrolytes and functionalized carbon nanotube-coated cellulose paper electrodes, was investigated in this work. Briefly, acidic PVA-[BMIM]Cl-lactic acid-LiBr and neutral PVA-[BMIM]Cl-sodium acetate-LiBr hydrogel polymer electrolytes are used as catholyte and anolyte, respectively. The acidic condition of the catholyte contributes to suppression of the undesired irreversible reaction of Br- and extension of the oxygen evolution reaction potential to a higher value than that of the redox potential of Br-/Br3- reaction. The observed Br-/Br3- redox activity at the cathode contributes to enhance the cathode capacitance. The neutral condition of the anolyte helps extend the operating voltage window of the supercapacitor by introducing hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential to the anode. The electrosorption of nascent H on the negative electrode also increases the anode capacitance. As a result, the prepared solid-state hybrid supercapacitor shows a broad voltage window of 1.6 V, with a high Coulombic efficiency of 97.6% and the highest energy density of 16.3 Wh/kg with power density of 932.6 W/kg at 2 A/g obtained. After 10 000 cycles of galvanostatic charge and discharge tests at the current density of 10 A/g, it exhibits great cyclic stability with 93.4% retention of the initial capacitance. In addition, a robust capacitive performance can also be observed from the solid-state supercapacitor at different bending angles, indicating its great potential as a flexible energy storage device. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

Based on these dilemmas and working principles, emerging strategies to render solid-state Li-metal batteries are summarized. Finally, the general conclusion and perspective on the current limitations and recommended research of solid-state Li-metal batteries are presented. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.; Li metal is extensively focused because of its ultra-high theoretical capacity (3,860 mAh g−1, 10 times higher than that of graphite) and the most negative electrochemical potential (−3.040 V versus standard hydrogen electrode).

 Abstract:  Perovskite-type borohydride, NH4Ca(BH4)3, is considered as a promising hydrogen storage material due to its high gravimetric hydrogen capacity (15.7 wt%). In this work, the dehydrogenation performance and reaction pathway of NH4Ca(BH4)3 have been systematically investigated. It is found that the initial decomposition temperature is only 65 °C, suggesting a low thermodynamic stability of NH4Ca(BH4)3. The desorption kinetics conducted by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicates that the activation energy of decomposition is about 226.1 kJ/mol. The dehydrogenation pathway of NH4Ca(BH4)3 characterized by fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shows a stepwise decomposition process, in which the initial dehydrogenation is due to destabilization of H+ in NH4 and H- in BH4 followed by the subsequent dehydrogenation steps arising from the decomposition of homologous NH3BH3 and the final decomposition of Ca(BH4)2 at a high temperature, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Mg-based metal hydride is one of the most promising materials for hydrogen energy storage. However, the high thermal stability due to strong bonding effects between the atoms limits its practical application. In order to reduce the thermal stability, a method of doping double nonmetals into Mg-based system was proposed in this study. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation results showed that the thermal stabilities of both the B-N co-doped Mg-based alloy and its hydride are reduced compared with pure Mg-based system. The relative formation enthalpies of the alloy and its hydride are 0.323 and 0.595 eV atom−1, respectively. The values are much higher than those for either singly B- or N-doped Mg-based system. The more significant destabilization by doping double nonmetal elements than single element is mainly attributed to a dual effect in weakening Mg–Ni/NiH4 bonds, caused by criss-cross interactions between B–Ni and N–Mg bonds. © 2018, EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

 Abstract:  Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) has been proposed as a potential hydrogen storage material for fuel cells, and the development of highly active and robust catalysts for hydrolyzing NaBH4 is the key for the practical usage of NaBH4 for fuel cells. Herein we report Co-nanocrystal assembled hollow nanoparticles (Co-HNP) as an active and robust catalyst for the hydrolysis of NaBH4. A hydrogen generation rate of 10.8 L·min-1·g-1 at 25°C was achieved by using the Co-HNP catalyst with a low activation energy of 23.7 kJ·mol-1, which is among the best performance of reported noble and non-noble catalysts for hydrolyzing NaBH4. Co-HNP also showed good stability in the long term cycling tests. The mechanism of the catalytic hydrolysis of NaBH4 on Co-HNP was studied by using 1H and 11B solid-state NMR, which provided unambiguous experimental evidence of the Co-H formation. The systematically designed NMR experiments unveiled the key role of Co-HNP in the activation of borohydride and the subsequent transfer of H- to water for generating H2 gas and helped to distinguish various hypotheses proposed for catalytic H2 generation reactions. The porous hollow nanostructure of the Co-HNP catalyst provides large surface area and facilitates mass transfer. The facile preparation and outstanding performance of Co-HNP enables it as a very competitive catalyst for hydrogen production. (Chemical Equation Presented). © 2017 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Within this paper, a hydrogen sensor based on onion-like carbons (OLCs) is proposed and its behaviour is assessed in detail. The OLCs prove to be ideal candidates for the development of solid-state sensing technology of hydrogen working at room temperature, due to their hydrophobic nature and their non-porous texture. Using dielectrophoreis as a method of electromanipulation, the OLCs undergo ultrasonication in ethanol and, according to the analysis results through the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of OLC/C2H6O nanoparticles showed significant structural changes compared to the pristine OLCs. The fullerene C60 nanoparticles exposed to ethanol can present several solvation shells around the central fullerene molecule, and in the first layer of the solvation shell, ethanol molecules tend to form non-polar alkyl groups exposed to the surface, which contributes to the stimulation of structural defects of the OLC layers. The fast decrease in resistance of the OLC/C2H6O sensor under 10 ppm H2 exposure can be attributed to the switch of the nanoparticles to n-type semiconductor behaviour together with the additional increase in the number of electrons in the conduction band. Countless carbon-based sensing devices were previously reported, but the major drawback of these solutions was the irreversible response to hydrogen because of the high energy required by the adsorbed binding molecules to desorb from the material at low working temperatures. The sensor presented exploits the binding capacity of hydrogen to OLCs/C2H6O, as demonstrated by the previously proposed hydrogen storage solutions based on these fullerenes. In order to ensure sensors enhanced operability at room temperature current, stimulated desorption was used to stimulate desorption of the analyte molecules in the absence of an external heating source. © 2018, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.

 Abstract:   1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy was used for the study of corn starch plasticized with urea and/or glycerol. The information on the interactions between plasticizers and starch macromolecules as well as the arrangement of starch macromolecules depending on the storage time (from 1 day to 52 weeks), were obtained from the broad-line and magic-angle spinning 1H NMR spectra measured at 22 °C and within the range from 30 to 140 °C and the cross-polarization magic-angle spinning (CP MAS) 13C NMR spectra measured at 30 °C. The 1H chemical shifts for the groups of the plasticizer molecules enabled characterization of the interactions between urea and glycerol molecules in starch plasticized with a mixture of urea and glycerol. With increasing temperature, the signal related to water molecules gradually vanished due to water evaporation, and resolved 1H peaks associated with starch macromolecules were detected above 100 °C. The free water amount in the thermoplastic starch samples was also estimated using MAS 1H NMR spectra.

 Abstract:  We present time-resolved neutron-imaging results on the ortho- to para-hydrogen conversion in the presence of a nanoparticle powder of the ferromagnetic catalyst γ-Fe2O3. In particular, we were able to characterize the conversion rate as a function of time and position of molecular hydrogen with respect to the catalyst. Results are reported for liquid and solid molecular hydrogen at 15 and 10 K, respectively. We discuss how newly generated para-hydrogen poisons the catalyst, thus slowing the process and preventing the full conversion of large quantities of condensed molecular hydrogen, and we underline how the performance of the conversion critically depends on the loading procedure. Moreover, we suggest how a honeycomb distribution of the catalyst in a vessel can boost the conversion rates while minimzing the amount of material needed. Finally, we show how state-of-the-art energy-selective imaging using pulsed neutrons can be used to provide molecular specificity beyond what is currently possible for in situ and operando kinetic studies, with direct industrial applications such as the well-known ""boil-off"" problem associated with the low-temperature storage of molecular hydrogen. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Design of adsorbents with high stability and efficiency to achieve rapid uptake and high capacity for dye pollutants is a key challenge in environmental remedies. Herein, we have design and synthesized three triazene-based imine and azine functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs 1-3) via the formation of imine bonds by the condensation of a flexible tripodal tri aldehyde (TFPT) with linear diamines. The COFs are characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, solid-state NMR, TGA, FESEM, TEM, and DRS. They exhibit permanent porosity with high surface areas and N2 uptake capacities of 540, 1600, and 2235 cc/g by COFs 1-3, respectively. They are found to be chemically and thermally stable and exhibit moderate hydrogen storage capacities. Photophysical studies reveal that COFs 1-3 exhibited low band gap values of 3.0, 2.5, and 2.25 eV, respectively, indicating their semiconducting nature. All three materials are highly luminescent, and their emission maxima are found to depend on the nature of the diamine linker. Further, COFs 1-3 are highly stable in water and function as robust adsorbents, as evidenced by their high rapid uptake capacity (>96%) toward anionic (MO, CR) and cationic (MB, CV) organic dye pollutants from their respective aqueous solutions (2.5 × 10-5 M). © 2018 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  First-principles studies of electronic structures, excitons, and defects in Li2B12H12 reveal unique photophysical properties of Li2B12H12 and its potential as a neutron scintillator material. We identify the electronic shell structure in (B12H12)2-, which gives rise to strong chemical stability of (B12H12)2- and a large band gap of Li2B12H12. Based on hybrid functional calculations, we show that excitons in Li2B12H12 are strongly self-trapped and predict that the exciton excitation and emission are both in the UV range and are not related to the bright blue emission observed in the experiment. The experimentally observed blue emission in Li2B12H12 is likely due to the emission of excitons bound to hydrogen vacancies. The calculated strong localization and large exciton trapping energy at hydrogen vacancies indicate enhanced radiative recombination, while the calculated large Stokes shift suggests that the self-absorption and the resonance transfer of the excitation energy may be suppressed. These properties should promote efficient defect emission at room temperature. The efficient defect emission, combined with the large thermal neutron capture cross-section by Li and B and the efficient energy transfer between fast neutrons and H, suggests potential applications of Li2B12H12 as a thermal or fast neutron scintillator. Optical characterization of VH may also be used to monitor H and Li concentrations in Li2B12H12-based hydrogen storage materials and solid-state electrolytes in Li batteries.

 Abstract:  Solid ammonia borane is a promising hydrogen storage material but suffers from a slow and ill-controlled dehydrogenation process. We studied intrinsic point defects that might play a role for hydrogen release by means of first-principles calculations augmented with van der Waals (vdW) corrections. The vdW corrections proved to be crucial for structural properties and also for energies in some cases. For vacancy and interstitial defects of single H as well as of molecular (NH3, BH3) type, we determined formation energies and local lattice structures of the defects in various charge states. Atomic H-related vacancies and interstitials exist predominantly in charged states in agreement with their chemical, i.e., protonic or hydridic, character. For molecular defects, some NH3- and BH3-related neutral defects have rather low formation energies, suggesting that the dehydrogenation of undoped ammonia borane is initiated by the cleavage of the B-N bond. The relaxation pictures associated with H-related defects can explain the observation of a variety of oligomeric products in experiment. Besides, some low-energy defects are found to form H2 molecules spontaneously and thus might catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction of doped ammonia borane. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Constructing well defined nanostructures is promising but still challenging for high-efficiency catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and energy storage. Herein, utilizing the differences in surface energies between (111) facets of CoP and NiCoP, a novel CoP/NiCoP heterojunction is designed and synthesized with a nanotadpoles (NTs)-like morphology via a solid-state phase transformation strategy. By effective interface construction, the disorder in terms of electronic structure and coordination environment at the interface in CoP/NiCoP NTs is created, which leads to dramatically elevated HER performance within a wide pH range. Theoretical calculations prove that an optimized proton chemisorption and H2O dissociation are achieved by an optimized phosphide polymorph at the interface, accelerating the HER reaction. The CoP/NiCoP NTs are also proved to be excellent candidates for use in supercapacitors (SCs) with a high specific capacitance (1106.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and good cycling stability (nearly 100% initial capacity retention after 1000 cycles). An asymmetric supercapacitor shows a high energy density (145 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and good cycling stability (capacitance retention is 95% after 3200 cycles).

 Abstract:  Solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) have been receiving significant attention for future energy storage and hydrogen production applications. This research focuses on the electrolyte material which can be used for both SOEC and SOFC particularly on 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) electrolyte material. YSZ has been used because of its high stability at elevated temperature, excellent mechanical and chemical properties and its excellent oxygen ion conductivity. This study aims to determine the effect of precursor's grain size and sintering temperature on the properties of YSZ as electrolyte material for SOEC. Solid-state sintering was done to transform the ceramic powders into solid compacts. Pure cubic fluorite structure YSZ was achieved by both micrograined and nanograined YSZ sintered at 1200°C and 1500°C. It was observed that the micrograined YSZ sample sintered at 1500°C achieved the highest relative density at 99.48%. SEM images showed a smooth and compact microstructure for micrograined YSZ while small pores were still present in the micrographs of nanograined YSZ.

 Abstract:  Bi4Ti3O12–x nanosheet photocatalysts with abundant oxygen vacancies are fabricated by a facile solid-state chemical reduction method for the first time. This method is simple in operation, has short reaction time, and can be conducted at mild temperatures (300~400 ºC). The electron paramagnetic resonance, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, and positron annihilation lifetime spectra results indicate that oxygen vacancies are produced in Bi4Ti3O12–x, and they can be adjusted by tuning the reduction reaction conditions. Control experiments show that the reduction time and temperature have great influences on the photocatalytic activities of Bi4Ti3O12–x. The optimal Bi4Ti3O12–x x is the sample undergoing the reduction treatment at 350 ºC for 60 min and it affords a hydrogen evolution rate of 129 µmol_g–1_h–1 under visible-light irradiation, which is about 3.4 times that of the pristine Bi4Ti3O12–x. The Bi4Ti3O12–x photocatalysts have good reusability and storage stability and can be used to decompose formaldehyde and formic acid for hydrogen production. The surface oxygen vacancies states result in the broadening of the valence band and the narrowing of the band gap. Such energy level structure variation helps promote the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs thus leading to enhancement in the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Meanwhile, the narrowing of the band gap leads to a broader visible light absorption of Bi4Ti3O12–x. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

 Abstract:                               This study elucidates the influence of molecular attributes on the observed dynamic stiffening in select two-component polyurethanes upon high strain-rate impact.

 Abstract:  Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), emerging as a new type of solid state porous material, have received intensive attention in academia and industry over the last two decades. MOF materials demonstrate not only intriguing structures/topologies, but also a variety of functionalities/applications, i.e., mediating the currentdemanding energy crisis and environmental pollution. We are interested in the design and self-assembly of functional MOF materials to improve carbon dioxide, hydrogen, methane and acetylene storage capabilities, as well as the separation efficiencies toward flue gas and nature gas. Therefore, significant efforts have been devoted to construct a subclass of amide-functionalized metal–organic frameworks (AFMOFs) in the last decade in our research group to target the above-mentioned applications. Due to the intrinsic nature, i.e., flexibility and polarizability of amide groups, the resultant AFMOFs unveil a myriad of graceful structures/topologies in combination with enhanced gas storage and separation properties. Depending on where the amide groups are implanted into the organic backbones, two types of AFMOFs were essentially afforded in our research group. In this review, we first pay some attention to the synthesis and structures of dynamic AFMOFs, in which the amide groups are built between carboxymethyl and phenyl rings, then we discuss the designs, syntheses and constructions of robust AFMOFs by means of several intriguingly topological platforms, i.e., pcu-, agw-, nbo-, rht-, pbz- and txt-MOFs, where the amide groups are built between two phenyl rings.

 Abstract:  The rational design of stable, inexpensive catalysts with excellent hydrogen dynamics and sorption characteristics under realistic environments for reversible hydrogen storage remains a great challenge. Here, we present a simple and scalable strategy to fabricate a monodispersed, air-stable, magnesium hydride embedded in three-dimensional activated carbon with periodic synchronization of transition metals (MHCH). The high surface area, homogeneous distribution of MgH2 nanoparticles, excellent thermal stability, high energy density, steric confinement by carbon, and robust architecture of the catalyst resulted in a noticeable enhancement of the hydrogen storage performance. The resulting MHCH-5 exhibited outstanding hydrogen storage performance, better than that of most reported Mg-based hydrides, with a high storage density of 6.63 wt% H2, a rapid kinetics loading in <5 min at 180 °C, superior reversibility, and excellent long-term cycling stability over ∼435 h. The significant reduction of the enthalpy and activation energy observed in the MHCH-5 demonstrated enhancement of the kinetics of de-/hydrogenation compared to that of commercial MgH2. The origin of the intrinsic hydrogen thermodynamics was elucidated via solid state 1H NMR.

 Abstract:  MXenes have emerged as promising high-volumetric-capacitance supercapacitor electrode materials, whereas their voltage windows are not wide. This disadvantage prevents MXenes from being made into aqueous symmetric supercapacitors with high energy density. To attain high energy density, constructing asymmetric supercapacitors is a reliable design choice. Here, we propose a strategy to achieve high energy density of hydrogen ion aqueous-based hybrid supercapacitors by integrating a negative electrode of Ti3C2Tx MXene and a positive electrode of redox-active hydroquinone (HQ)/carbon nanotubes. The two electrodes are separated by a Nafion film that is proton permeable in H2SO4 electrolyte. Upon charging/discharging, hydrogen ions shuttle back and forth between the cathode and anode for charge compensation. The proton-induced high capacitance of MXene and HQ, along with complementary working voltage windows, simultaneously enhance the electrochemical performance of the device. Specifically, the hybrid supercapacitors operate in a 1.6 V voltage window and deliver a high energy density of 62 Wh kg1, which substantially exceeds those of the state-of-the-art aqueous asymmetric supercapacitors reported so far. Additionally, the device exhibits excellent cycling stability and the all-solid-state planar hybrid supercapacitor displays exceptional flexibility and integration for bipolar cells to boost the capacitance and voltage output. These encouraging results provide the possibility of designing high-energy-density noble-metal-free asymmetric supercapacitors for practical applications. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

The effect of calcination temperatures on phase formation, reaction kinetics, and heat of reaction of the solid–state product was investigated by ex situ, in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Hydrogen sorption properties of the compound were investigated by mass spectrometer. The crystallographic parameters of binary and ternary Mg–Nb–O phases were extracted by Rietveld method. During solid–state synthesis, the formation of MgNb2O6 provides single-step reaction between precursor materials proved by in situ experiment and the heat of formation as well as driving force was calculated from calorimetric analysis. © 2018, Australian Ceramic Society.

 Abstract:  Insertion is a widely utilized process for reversibly changing the stoichiometry of a solid through a chemical or electrochemical stimulus. Insertion is instrumental to many energy technologies, including batteries, fuel cells, and hydrogen storage, and has been the subject of extensive investigations. More recently, solid-state switching devices utilizing insertion have drawn significant interest; such devices dynamically switch a material's chemical stoichiometry, changing it from one state to another. This review illustrates the fundamental properties and mechanisms of insertion, including reaction, diffusion, and phase transformation, and discusses recent developments in characterization in these fields. We also review new classes of recently demonstrated insertion devices, which reversibly switch mechanical and electronic properties, and show how the fundamental mechanisms of insertion can be used to design improved switching devices. © Copyright 2018 by Annual Reviews.

 Abstract:  Metal-organic frameworks are chemically versatile materials and are excellent candidates for many applications from carbon capture to drug delivery, through hydrogen storage. While most studies so far focus on the crystalline MOFs, there has been a recent shift to the study of their disordered states, such as defective structures, glasses, gels, and very recently liquid MOFs. Following the publication of the melting mechanism of zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-4, we use here molecular simulation in order to investigate the similarities and differences with two other zeolitic imidazolate frameworks, ZIF-8 and ZIF-zni. We perform first-principles molecular dynamics simulations to study the melting phenomena and the nature of the liquids obtained, focusing on structural characterization at the molecular scale, dynamics of the species, and thermodynamics of the solid-liquid transition. We show how the retention of chemical configuration, the changes in the coordination network, and the variation of the porous volume in the liquid phase are influenced by the parent crystalline framework. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Demand for pragmatic alternatives to carbon-intensive fossil fuels is growing more strident. Hydrogen represents an ideal zero-carbon clean energy carrier with high energy density. For hydrogen fuel to compete with alternatives, safe and high capacity storage materials that are readily cycled are imperative. Here, development of such a material, comprised of nickel-doped Mg nanocrystals encapsulated by molecular-sieving reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layers, is reported. While most work on advanced hydrogen storage composites to date endeavor to explore either nanosizing or addition of carbon materials as secondary additives individually, methods to enable both are pioneered: “dual-channel” doping combines the benefits of two different modalities of enhancement. Specifically, both external (rGO strain) and internal (Ni doping) mechanisms are used to efficiently promote both hydriding and dehydriding processes of Mg nanocrystals, simultaneously achieving high hydrogen storage capacity (6.5 wt% in the total composite) and excellent kinetics while maintaining robustness. Furthermore, hydrogen uptake is remarkably accomplished at room temperature and also under 1 bar—as observed during in situ measurements—which is a substantial advance for a reversible metal hydride material. The realization of three complementary functional components in one material breaks new ground in metal hydrides and makes solid-state materials viable candidates for hydrogen-fueled applications. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

 Abstract:  Abstract: The study of hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts for water electrolysis is a developing field in which noble metal-based materials are commonly used. However, the associated high cost and low abundance of noble metals limit their practical application. Non-noble metal catalysts, aside from being inexpensive, highly abundant and environmental friendly, can possess high electrical conductivity, good structural tunability and comparable electrocatalytic performances to state-of-the-art noble metals, particularly in alkaline media, making them desirable candidates to reduce or replace noble metals as promising electrocatalysts for water electrolysis. This article will review and provide an overview of the fundamental knowledge related to water electrolysis with a focus on the development and progress of non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts in alkaline, polymer exchange membrane and solid oxide electrolysis. A critical analysis of the various catalysts currently available is also provided with discussions on current challenges and future perspectives.

 Abstract:  A safe and efficient method for storing hydrogen is solid state storage through a chemical reaction in metal hydrides. A good amount of research has been conducted on hydrogenation properties of metal hydrides and possible methods to improve them. Background research shows that heat transfer is one of the reaction rate controlling parameters in a metal hydride hydrogen storage system. Considering that some very well-known hydrides like lanthanum nickel (LaNi5) and magnesium hydride (MgH2) are paramagnetic materials, the effect of an external magnetic field on heat conduction and reaction kinetics in a metal hydride storage system w i t h such materials needs to be studied. In the current paper, hydrogenation properties of lanthanum nickel under magnetism were studied. The properties which were under consideration include reaction kinetics, hydrogen absorption capacity, and hydrogenation time. Experimentation has proven the positive effect of applying magnetic fields on the heat conduction, reaction kinetics, and hydrogenation time of a lanthanum nickel bed. However, magnetism did not increase the hydrogenation capacity of lanthanum nickel, which is evidence to prove that elevated hydrogenation characteristics result from enhanced heat transfer in the bed. © 2017 by the authors.

 Abstract:  A closed-cycle system for light-harvesting, storage, and heat release is important for utilizing and managing renewable energy. However, combining a high-energy, stable photochromic material with a controllable trigger for solid-state heat release remains a great challenge for developing photothermal fuels (PTFs). This paper presents a uniform PTF film fabricated by the assembly of close-packed bisazobenzene (bisAzo) grafted onto reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The assembled rGO–bisAzo template exhibited a high energy density of 131 Wh kg−1 and a long half-life of 37 days owing to inter- or intramolecular H-bonding and steric hindrance. The rGO–bisAzo PTF film released and accumulated heat to realize a maximum temperature difference (DT) of 15 °C and a DT of over 10 °C for 30 min when the temperature difference of the environment was greater than100 °C. Controlling heat release in the solid-state assembly paves the way to develop highly efficient and high-energy PTFs for a multitude of applications. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

 Abstract:  A novel solid-solution MXene (Ti0.5V0.5)3C2 is successfully synthesized by exfoliating a solid-solution MAX phase (Ti0.5V0.5)3AlC2, and its catalytic effect on the hydrogen storage reaction of Mg is systemically evaluated for the first time. Typical layer morphology is observed for the prepared (Ti0.5V0.5)3C2, which exhibits a better catalytic activity than that of Ti3C2. The addition of 10 wt% (Ti0.5V0.5)3C2 remarkably reduces the dehydrogenation onset temperature of MgH2 by 70 °C, from 266 to 196 °C. At 250 °C, approximately 5.0 wt% H2 is released from the 10 wt% (Ti0.5V0.5)3C2-containing MgH2 within 20 min. The dehydrogenated sample rapidly absorbs 4.8 wt% H2 within 5 s at 120 °C; these hydrogenation kinetics are much more superior even to the well-studied Nb2O5 catalyst. The apparent activation energy is calculated to be 77.3 kJ/mol for the MgH2-10 wt% (Ti0.5V0.5)3C2 sample, which is only around half of that of the pristine MgH2 (153.8 kJ/mol). This is responsible for the remarkably reduced dehydrogenation operating temperature. Moreover, the chemical states of (Ti0.5V0.5)3C2 during dehydrogenation are also analysed and discussed. © 2018 Acta Materialia Inc.

High dielectric constant fillers improve the energy density of the capacitors but at the cost of decreased efficiency, large dielectric loss as well as electrical conduction at high fields. In this paper, we present a novel dielectric core-satellite BT-gold (Au) nanoparticles (NPs) for high energy density capacitor application. Hydroxylated BT NPs (BTO NPs) were immobilized with Au NPs of size ∼4 nm and were used as fillers into PVDF polymer matrix. The results show that the incorporation of Au on BT NPs improved the dielectric constant, energy density as well as efficiency, while reduction in the dielectric loss. To further improve the dielectric properties, Au-BTO NPs were coated with 2,3,4,5,6-Pentafluorothiophenol (PFTP) layer. The dielectric properties were further tuned with different PFTP concentrations. The PFTP serves as the bridge between NPs and PVDF polymer by forming hydrogen bonding. The dielectric properties were measured at two different PFTP concentrations (PFTP1 and PFTP1.5, where 1 and 1.5 refer to the molar ratios of PFTP and Au decorated BT NPs). The lower PFTP concentration results in improved dielectric properties while increasing the concentration decreases the overall performance of the capacitors. The energy density of PFTP1-Au-BTO/PVDF was 2.04 J cm                             −3                              at ∼2100 kV cm                             −1                              which was ∼21% higher than that of PVDF and 70% higher than biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP), a present state-of-the-art dielectric polymer. Thus, the combination of both, Au decoration on BT NPs and hydrogen bonding of PFTP with PVDF chains are responsible for improved dielectric properties and make these nanocomposites a promising candidate for energy storage applications.                          © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

 Abstract:  Graphitic carbon nitride with nitrogen defects (g-C3N4-x) is prepared by a facile and effective solid-state chemical reduction technique at mild temperature conditions. The cyano groups and nitrogen vacancies, as evidenced by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) and Solid-state 13C MAS NMR spectra, are controllable via adjusting chemical reduction temperature. Comparing to the pristine g-C3N4, the as-prepared g-C3N4-x shows much enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution activity under visible-light irradiation. The maximum H2 evolution rate of 3068 μmol·g−1·h−1 is achieved with g-C3N4-x after chemical reduction treatment at 400 °C for 1 h, which is 4.85 times that of the pristine g-C3N4. Moreover, excellent reusability and storage stability have been shown by this photocatalyst as well. It is discovered that nitrogen defects can result in both the up-shift of the valance band and the down-shift of the conduction band, which benefit the absorption of longer wavelength photons and trapping of the photoinduced electrons, therefore reducing the recombination losses of the generated carriers. It is because of this improved visible-light absorption and charge carrier separation, g-C3N4-x displays better visible-light photocatalytic activity compared to the pristine g-C3N4. It is then concluded that the synthetic strategy presented here represents a straightforward and efficient way to synergistically optimize the chemical composition, optical response, and photocatalytic characteristics of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

 Abstract:  Two approaches of engineering surface structures of V-Ti-based solid solution hydrogen storage alloys are presented, which enable improved tolerance toward gaseous oxygen (O2) impurities in hydrogen (H2) gas. Surface modification is achieved through engineering lanthanum (La)- or nickel (Ni)-rich surface layers with enhanced cyclic stability in an H2/O2 mixture. The formation of a Ni-rich surface layer does not improve the cycling stability in H2/O2 mixtures. Mischmetal (Mm, a mixture of La and Ce) agglomerates are observed within the bulk and surface of the alloy when small amounts of this material are added during arc melting synthesis. These agglomerates provide hydrogen-transparent diffusion pathways into the bulk of the V-Ti-Cr-Fe hydrogen storage alloy when the remaining oxidized surface is already nontransparent for hydrogen. Thus, the cycling stability of the alloy is improved in an O2-containing hydrogen environment as compared to the same alloy without addition of Mm. The obtained surface-engineered storage material still absorbs hydrogen after 20 cycles in a hydrogen-oxygen mixture, while the original material is already deactivated after 4 cycles. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  The synthesis of a nanocomposite gel polymer electrolytes (NGPEs) using Li+-functionalized SPEEK (SPEEK(Li)) nanofiber membrane as a matrix, cross-linked PVA as a gelled agent and LiClO4 as an electrolytic salt for electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) were reported in this work.

 Abstract:  To fully leverage the advantages of ionic liquids for many applications, it is necessary to immobilize or encapsulate the fluids within an inert, robust, quasi-solid-state format that does not disrupt their many desirable, inherent features. The formation of ionogels represents a promising approach; however, many earlier approaches suffer from solvent/matrix incompatibility, optical opacity, embrittlement, matrix-limited thermal stability, and/or inadequate ionic liquid loading. We offer a solution to these limitations by demonstrating a straightforward and effective strategy toward flexible and durable ionogels comprising bacterial cellulose supports hosting in excess of 99% ionic liquid by total weight. Termed bacterial cellulose ionogels (BCIGs), these gels are prepared using a facile solvent-exchange process equally amenable to water-miscible and water-immiscible ionic liquids. A suite of characterization tools were used to study the preliminary (thermo)physical and structural properties of BCIGs, including no-deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Our analyses reveal that the weblike structure and high crystallinity of the host bacterial cellulose microfibrils are retained within the BCIG. Notably, not only can BCIGs be tailored in terms of shape, thickness, and choice of ionic liquid, they can also be designed to host virtually any desired active, functional species, including fluorescent probes, nanoparticles (e.g., quantum dots, carbon nanotubes), and gas-capture reagents. In this paper, we also present results for fluorescent designer BCIG chemosensor films responsive to ammonia or hydrogen sulfide vapors on the basis of incorporating selective fluorogenic probes within the ionogels. Additionally, a thermometric BCIG hosting the excimer-forming fluorophore 1,3-bis(1-pyrenyl)propane was devised which exhibited a ratiometric (two-color) fluorescence output that responded precisely to changes in local temperature. The ionogel approach introduced here is simple and has broad generality, offering intriguing potential in (bio)analytical sensing, catalysis, membrane separations, electrochemistry, energy storage devices, and flexible electronics and displays. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  This work deals with the characterization of magnesium-lanthanum powders deposits produced with an electrodeposition technique using an aqueous solution based on magnesium chloride and lanthanum(III) nitrate. In recent years, the interest for magnesium-based alloys is growing due to their potential use as solid state systems for hydrogen storage. This work is a preliminary study on the synthesis of magnesium-lanthanum powders oriented to their later evaluation in systems for hydrogen storage. Magnesium and Lanthanum are deposited on a copper plate used as a cathode. Chemical composition, structure and morphology are investigated by EDS, XRD, FTIR and SEM. The effect of voltage on powders characteristics is studied considering three values (3, 3.5 and 4 V). EDS analysis shows the presence of three major elements (Mg, La and O) with a little amount of Cl. The weight percentages of Mg and O increase whereas the one of La decreases with the growth of voltage. Morphological characterization reveals that heterogeneous chemical structures are formed on the surface of the electrode and the size of aggregates decreases with the increase of voltage. From the results of X-ray analysis the deposits reveal the significant presence of two phases: Mg(OH)2 and La(OH)3. The peaks originating from the Mg(OH)2 phase has a non-monotonic behavior and those of La(OH)3 phase increase with the increase of voltage. FTIR analysis confirms the presence of the two phases identified in XRD diffractograms and exhibits that their corresponding transmittance values increase for higher voltage values. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Nowadays energy storage seems to be a vital point in any new energy paradigm. It has become an important and strategic issue, to ensure the energetic sufficiency of humanity. Indeed, hydrogen storage in solids has been proved and revealed as clean and efficient energy storage. Moreover, it can be thought as a seriously considered solution to enable renewable energy to be a part of our quotidian life. To achieve storing hydrogen in solid form, the present study aimed to concepts and simulates a solid-state hydrogen storage reactor (tank). An investigation of the parameters influencing the hydrogen storage performance is carried out. Meanwhile, to understand the physical phenomenon taking place during the storage of hydrogen, a 2D numerical modelling for a metal hydrides-based in hydrogen reactor is presented. A strong coupling between energy balance, kinetic law, as well as a mass momentum balance at sorbent bed temperature under a non-uniform pressure was resolved based on finite element method. The temporal evolutions of pressure, the raising temperature in the bed during the hydriding process as well as the impact of the hydrogen supply pressure within the tank are analysed and validated by comparison with the experimental work in literature, a good agreement is obtained.

The MgH2 nanoparticle-10 wt % graphene nanosheet composites possess the best hydrogen storage properties among Mg-based materials.

In this letter, we investigate the stability of the magnetic properties of some hydrides with maximum hydrogen content (namely, TmFe11TiH1 and Tm2Fe17H5.5) in a wide temperature range using high magnetic fields. The magnetic phase transition from the ferrimagnetic to the ferromagnetic state was studied immediately after hydrides were obtained, as well as after one year of storage of the samples at ambient temperature. Only the TmFe11TiH hydride is stable over time. The effect of hydrogen on the magnetothermal properties of the Nd2Fe14B and Nd1Pr1Fe14B compounds and a range of magnetic phase transitions were also investigated. Hydrogenation leads to a decrease in the magnetocaloric effect in all investigated compounds as a result of an increase in the distance between magnetically active ions due to the lattice expansion.

 Abstract:                               Magnesium hydride (MgH                             2                             ) has been considered to be one of the most promising solid-state hydrogen storage materials owing to its high hydrogen capacities, excellent reversibility and abundant source. However, the high dehydrogenation energy barrier and poor kinetics embarrass the practical application of MgH                             2                              in fuel cell. Doping nano-catalyst is deemed to be the most effective method to improve kinetics property of hydrogen storage materials, but the nanoparticles generally suffer from agglomeration and inactivation during the cycling hydrogen storage. Here we present a promising strategy to facilely prepare a high-efficiency transition metal oxide nano-catalyst, TiO                             2                              nanoparticles, in which monodispersed single-crystal-like TiO                             2                              nanoparticles are wrapped with amorphous carbon.

A significant reductions of hydrogen desorption temperature (163.5 °C) and activation energy (69.2 kJ mol                             −1                             ) have been obtained for the TiO                             2                              nanoparticles/amorphous carbon catalyzed MgH                             2                             , which can be fully rehydrogenated with a reversible capacity of about 6.5 wt% at 200 °C within 5 min, and then completely dehydrogenated at 275 °C within 10 min. It is demonstrated that such significantly improved hydrogen desorption properties can be attributed to the in-situ formation of TiO                             2                              nanoparticles, amorphous carbon and multi-valance Ti species, which play the synergistically catalytic roles in the nano-catalyst.

 Abstract:  MgH2 doped with transition metal halides (TiF4, NbF5, and ZrCl4) and activated carbon nanofibers (ACNF) for reversible hydrogen storage is prepared by ball milling technique. Transition metal halides provide catalytic effects for de/rehydrogenation kinetics, while ACNF benefits thermal conductivity and hydrogen permeability as well as prevents particle agglomeration during cycling. Significant reduction of onset and main dehydrogenation temperatures of MgH2 (ΔT = 243 and 158 °C, respectively) are achieved by doping with 5–10 wt % of NbF5, ACNF-TiF4 and ACNF-NbF5. During the 1st cycle, the latter samples liberate 4.7–5.0 wt % H2 within 1 h 30 min, whereas MgH2 doped with ACNF reaches only 1.5 wt % H2. The reaction between MgF2 and NbHx (x < 1) (MgH2-NbF5 and MgH2-ACNF-NbF5) during dehydrogenation results in the formation of new catalytic active species of Nb-F-Mg favoring kinetics. Upon four hydrogen release and uptake cycles, kinetics and reversibility within 1 h 30 min of MgH2-ACNF-NbF5 are preserved at 5.0 wt % H2, while those of MgH2-NbF5 and MgH2-ACNF-TiF4 decay to 4.4 wt % H2. Activation energy (EA) for dehydrogenation of MgH2 considerably decreases from 140.0 ± 10.2 to 37.8 ± 1.5 kJ/mol after doing with ACNF-NbF5. Superior performance of MgH2-ACNF-NbF5 to MgH2-NbF5 is due to synergistic effects of NbF5 and ACNF.

 Abstract:  H- ion conductor materials have the great potential to enable high-energy density electrochemical storage based on hydrogen. Fast H- conduction has been recently demonstrated in the La2-x-ySrx+yLiH1-x+yO3-y oxyhydride materials. However, little is known about the H- diffusion mechanism in this new material and its unique structure. The origin of such exceptional H- conduction in the oxide-based materials is of great interest. Using first-principles calculations, we studied the energetics and diffusion mechanisms of H- ions as a function of structures and compositions in this oxyhydride system. Our study identified that fast H- diffusion is mediated by H- vacancies and that the fast two-dimensional or three-dimensional H- diffusion is activated by different anion sublattices in different compositions. In addition, novel doping was predicted from ab initio computation to increase H- conductivity in these materials. The unique two-anion-site feature in this structural framework enables highly tunable lattice and minimizes the blocking of anion diffusion by oxygen sublattice, allowing high mobile-carrier concentration and good diffusion network. This conclusion offers general guidance for future design and discovery of novel oxide-based anion conductors. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Understanding diffusion of large solutes such as hydrogen and lithium in solids is of paramount importance for energy storage in metal hydrides and advanced batteries. Due to its high gravimetric and volumetric densities, magnesium is a material of great potential for solid-state hydrogen storage. However, the slow hydrogen diffusion kinetics and the deleterious blocking effect in magnesium have hampered its practical applications. Here, we demonstrate fast lateral hydrogen diffusion in quasifree magnesium films without the blocking effect. Massive concomitant lattice expansion leads to the formation of remarkable self-organized finger patterns extending over tens of micrometers. Detailed visualization of diffusion fronts reveals that the fingers in these patterns follow locally the direction of hydrogen diffusion. Thus, the streamlines of the diffusion process are self-recorded by means of the finger pattern. By inclusion of fast hydrogen diffusion objects or local gaps, the resulting streamlines exhibit a clear analogy to optical rays in geometric optics. The possibility to spatially manipulate hydrogen diffusion opens an avenue to build advanced hydrogen storage systems, cloaking and active plasmonic devices, as well as prototype systems for computational models. © 2018 American Physical Society.

 Abstract:  Ammonia is well-known as a hydrogen carrier owing to its high hydrogen capacity (17.8 wt %). However, the toxicity and the high storage pressure limit the application of ammonia. Consequently, storing ammonia in solid state has become the promising method to utilize ammonia for practical applications. In this review, ammonia absorption properties of metal hydrides, halides, and borohydrides to form metal amides and metal ammine complexes with various coordination numbers have been systematically summarized. Through this research, we found the correlation between the reactivity with ammonia and the Pauling electronegativity of neutral atoms according to different systems. Metal hydrides with small electronegativity value of the neutral atom of the cations can react with ammonia to form metal amides, which can be used as hydrogen storage material. For metal halides or borohydrides, the lower plateau pressure of ammonia absorption can be obtained in the material with larger electronegativity value of the neutral atom of cations. This useful tendency can be used in the materials design for the potential applications of ammonia-fed fuel cells. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Celecoxib is a COX II inhibitor NSAID which is used for joint pains, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, however due to its poor water solubility it shows very low oral bioavailability. Using solid dispersion formulations is one of the most promising strategies to increase solubility of poorly water soluble drugs. The purpose of this study is dissolution enhancement of celecoxib by preparation of solid dispersions via spray drying technique using PVP and Isomalt as hydrophilic carriers. Different ratios of celecoxib, Isomalt and PVP K30 (7:3:0, 5:5:0, 3:7:0, 1:9:0 and 3:5:2, 3:2:5) were prepared from 2% hydroalcoholic solutions (70:30 ethanol:water) using spray drier. Particle size analyzing, saturation solubility, SEM, DSC, FT-IR, XRPD and dissolution studies in 0.25% SDS and 0.04 M Na3HPO4 mediums were performed. Stability of samples was also studied after a week and a month storage at 75% humidity condition. The results showed that the saturation solubility of celecoxib in solid dispersion samples is 20–30 folds higher than raw celecoxib. Similar results have been shown for dissolution studies. Solid state analyses showed glass solution state of celecoxib in PVP/Isomalt matrixes. FTIR studies exhibited the formation of hydrogen bonding between celecoxib and PVP in these samples. Spray dried celecoxib (amorphous celecoxib) without usage of carrier showed lower dissolution rate compare to its crystalline state (in 0.25% SDS dissolution medium) whilst these results is vise versa in Na3PO4 dissolution medium. Interestingly almost all samples exhibited higher dissolution rate (in 0.25% SDS) after storage in 75% humidity. XRPD analysis demonstrated the crystallization of amorphous celecoxib after 1 month storage.

 Abstract:  Bimetallic borohydride borate LiCa3(BH4)(BO3)2 forms during decomposition of LiBH4–Ca(BH4)2–carbon composite studied for hydrogen storage. We present LiCa3(BH4)(BO3)2 as a material suitable for solid state electrolytes. The compound was studied by in situ Synchrotron Radiation X-ray Powder Diffraction, Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy and Cyclic Voltammetry. The conduction pathways in the crystal were estimated via Topology Analysis. Room temperature Li+ ionic conductivity reaches the value of 2.5 × 10− 6 S/cm with an activation energy of Ea = 0.25(5) eV. We have investigated the effect of doping on cation sites on the ionic conductivity in the temperature range 293–383 K, and showed that the heterovalent doping with Na+ increase RT σLi + up to 1 × 10− 5 S/cm with a saturation at 5 at.% of the dopant. Doping with Sr2 + of the Lithium excess containing samples enhances the Li+ conductivity by one order of magnitude in the same temperature range, and with the same saturation limit. In both cases the activation energy increases into the range of 0.47–0.63 eV which is also the case of self-doping with excess Lithium.

 Abstract:  A three-dimensional nanostructured nitrogen-doped graphene/carbon nanotube composite has been synthesized via a thermal annealing process, using the high surface attachment properties of uric acid (solid nitrogen precursor) with graphene oxide and oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotube. In the synthesis procedures, the attachment of uric acid to graphene oxide surfaces and the oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes via hydrogen bonding and electrostatic forces in the solution leads to a lamellar nanostructure during thermal annealing by the proper insertion of carbon nanotubes in graphene layers with nitrogen doping. The resultant composite has good atomic percentage of N (11.2 at. %) and shows superior electrochemical energy storage and conversion properties compared with nitrogen-doped graphene only and physically mixed nitrogen-doped graphene and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube samples. The composite exhibits high gravimetric and volumetric capacitance (324 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1) as electrode in solid-state supercapacitors, superior capacitive deionization (440 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1) in 1 M sodium chloride solution, and as high-performance anode in lithium-ion batteries (1150 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1) with long-term cycling stability. In addition, the composite demonstrates efficient metal-free bifunctional electrocatalysis toward the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, comparable with the commercial electrocatalysts.

 Abstract:  To circumvent the intermittence of the renewable energies, the future rarefaction of fossil fuels, and the climate problems, the use of an energy vector like hydrogen seems to be an ideal solution. It represents a good way to store energy massively over long periods of time that can be employed in a wide variety of systems such as mobility, heat, or industrial processes, and it has no impact on the carbon footprint. Moreover, it can be used for mobile or stationary applications using fuel cells or by direct combustion but its utilization depends on its storage, which represents currently a crucial problem. A medium for hydrogen storage at moderate temperature and pressure has to be developed, and the solid state storage in nanoporous two-dimensional and three-dimensional materials like graphene, aerogels, and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) structures could be a promising option for achieving satisfactory gravimetric and volumetric densities. However fundamental research is still needed to better understand the potential of this technology and to contemplate its development. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  Hydride reorientation is one of the crucial degradation mechanisms of cladding integrity under dry storage conditions. Recently, it has been experimentally reported that the threshold stress triggering the reorientation depends on various factors synergistically such as temperature, thermal history, hydrogen content, thermal cycling, and stress biaxiality. In this study, the combined effects of the hydrogen content and peak temperature on the threshold stress were studied using ring tension tests with a Zircaloy-4 cladding tube. To simulate the thermo-mechanical history of the cladding during interim dry storage, pre-hydrided specimens with hydrogen concentrations up to 585 wppm were tested following a transient temperature from a peak temperature, 350 °C or 400 °C, to room temperature. Results show that the threshold stress reaches a minimum when the hydrogen content is the terminal solid solubility of dissolution (TSSD) at a given peak temperature. The minimum stress was found to be 52 MPa and 75 MPa at 400 °C and 350 °C, respectively. With increasing hydrogen concentration, the threshold stress decreases in the regime of the solid solution state, whereas the stress steadily increases and then tends to saturate to a certain value in the regime of the supersaturated state. A qualitative model is presented to explain these findings on the basis of the mechanistic understanding of stress-driven hydrogen transport, memory effect, and radial hydride re-precipitation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Magnesium-based hydrogen storage materials are considered to be one of the most promising solid-state hydrogen storage materials due to their large hydrogen storage capacity and low cost. However, slow hydrogen absorption/desorption rate and excessive hydrogen absorption/desorption temperature limit the application of magnesium-based hydrogen storage materials.

Ball milling is the promising technology for preparing magnesium-based hydrogen storage materials. The research and development of approaches for modifying magnesium-based hydrogen storage materials prepared by ball milling is systematically expounded. It is concluded that ball milling can significantly improve the kinetic and electrochemical properties of magnesium-based hydrogen storage materials and increase the hydrogen storage capacity.

 Abstract:  The use of hydrogen as an energy vector presents different challenges for the scientific community, including the development of cost-effective, lasting, and safe hydrogen energy storage systems. Solid-state hydrogen storage as hydride compounds provides a prominent method regarding efficiency and safety. Transition complex hydrides such as Mg2CoH5 and Mg2FeH6 are attractive materials because of their high hydrogen storage density. Synthesis of these complex hydrides is not simple because of the lack of stable Mg2Fe and Mg2Co intermetallics. For this reason, a deeper knowledge of Mg-Co-H and Mg-Fe-H systems has been gained even before the synthesis of the pure hydride phases. Here, we discuss in detail major progress in synthesizing homoleptic Mg2CoH5 and Mg2FeH6 complex hydrides, the thermodynamic stability and kinetic properties of Mg-Co-H and Mg-Fe-H systems, and further advances in tuning them. Finally, main features in their practical applications as a hydrogen energy storage medium and future trends are highlighted. © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen storage materials based on the stoichiometry Mg(Ni1-xMnx)2 have been synthesized by High Energy Ball Milling (HEBM) and studied as potential candidate materials for solid state hydrogen storage. The microstructures of the as-cast and the milled alloys were characterized by means of X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) both prior and after the hydrogenation process. The storage characteristics (Pressure-Composition-Temperature isotherms) and the sorption kinetics obtained by a commercial and automatically controlled Sievert-type apparatus. The X-ray results showed that the substitution of Mn over Ni could eliminate and inhibit the MgNi2 phase. The calculation of the average crystallite size showed that the increase of the amount of Mn can reduce the size at the early stages, but for Mn content higher than 0.25 the crystallite size increases, while the microstrain levels decreased monotonically. The hydrogenation and dehydrogenation measurements took place at several temperatures (150–200–250–300 °C). The results showed that the kinetics for both the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation can be fast for operation at temperatures between 250 and 300 °C, but for temperatures below 200 °C the hydrogenation process is very slow, and the dehydrogenation process cannot be achieved. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

 Abstract:  Although metal hydrides are considered promising candidates for solid-state hydrogen storage, their use for practical applications remains a challenge due to the limitation imposed by the slow kinetics of hydrogen uptake and release, which has driven the interest in using metal nanoparticles as advanced materials of new hydrogen-storage systems since they display fast hydrogenation and dehydrogenation kinetics. Nevertheless, the understanding of the adsorption/release kinetics requires the investigation of the role played by the stress which appears to accommodate the misfit between the metal and hydride phases. In this paper, we present a continuum theory capable of assessing how the misfit stress affects the kinetics of hydride formation and growth in metallic nanoparticles. The theory is then applied to study the kinetics of adsorption/release in spherical particles.

 Abstract:  Severe plastic deformation techniques, such as high-pressure torsion (HPT), have been increasingly applied on powder materials to consolidate bulk nanostructured materials. In this context, the aim of the present study is to compare the plastic deformation characteristics during HPT of two distinct Mg-based powder precursors: (i) atomized micro-sized powder and (ii) condensed and passivated nanopowder. Dynamic recrystallization could take place during HPT consolidation of the atomized powder particles while the oxide pinning of the grain boundaries restricted it for the condensed powder. Consequently, there have been substantial differences in the development of the microstructure, texture, local strain heterogeneities, and hardness in the two types of consolidated products. Different types of local strain heterogeneities were also revealed in the consolidated products. The associated diversity in microstructure within the same consolidated product has been demonstrated to have an effect on the hydrogen activation kinetics to form hydrides for these Mg-based materials that could be suitable for solid state H-storage applications. © 2018 by the authors.

 Abstract:  A holistic approach is required for the development of materials and systems for hydrogen storage, embracing all the different steps involved in a successful advance of the technology. The several engineering solutions presented in this work try to address the technical challenges in synthesis and application of solid-state hydrogen storage materials, mainly metal hydride based compounds. Moving from the synthesis of samples in lab-scale to the production of industrial sized batches a novel process development is required, including safety approaches (for hazardous powders), and methods to prevent the contamination of sensitive chemicals. The reduction of overall costs has to be addressed as well, considering new sources for raw materials and more cost-efficient catalysts. The properties of the material itself influence the performances of the hydride in a pilot storage tank, but the characteristics of the system itself are crucial to investigate the reaction limiting steps and overcome hindrances. For this, critical experiments using test tanks are needed, learning how to avoid issues as material segregation or temperature gradients, and optimizing the design in the aspects of geometry, hull material, and test station facilities.

 Abstract:  The on-site hydrogen supply is a key issue for the commercialization of the fuel cells, which is one of the important ways for realizing a hydrogen-economy society. Composite NaNH2-NaBH4 is regarded as a promising high-capacity hydrogen storage material. In this paper, the composite NaNH2-NaBH4 (2/1) was synthesized via a solid-state ball milling method. To improve the hydrogen generation kinetics, a multiplex metal boride Mg-Co-B was selected as the catalyst. It was found that Na3BN2 and metal Na were byproducts in the thermal decomposed sample by X-ray diffraction analysis. Thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis indicated that the main decomposition stages of the catalyst promoted NaNH2-NaBH4 material were split into three stages. The activation energy of the Mg-Co-B promoted NaNH2-NaBH4 (2/1) material below 300 °C was 76.4 KJ/mol, which is only 47.9% of that of the pristine NaNH2-NaBH4 (2/1), and implying much better hydrogen generation kinetics.

 Abstract:  Adsorption and transport properties of ZnO nano-ribbons (ZnO-NRs) are investigated using density-functional theory (DFT) combined with non-equilibrium Green's-function (NEGF) formalism. Total-energy minimization shows the evidence for a selective chemisorption of three gases H2, O2 and CO2 to take place when ZnO-NR is N-doped. The calculated IV characteristics of ZnO-NR:N based device shows a trend of negative differential resistance (NDR). The NDR behavior persists to exist in the ZnO-NR:N device after the chemisorption of oxidizing-gases O2 and CO2, as causing more charge depletion of N-site, more impedance, and a broadening of NDR range. However, the NDR trend disappears in the case of chemisorption of reduced-gas H2, which donates charge to surface to rectify and enhance the conductance. The sensor responses, due to these three gases, are enormously large but yet with higher selectivity toward H2 gas. Consequently, NDR-based devices are proposed for high sensitivity and selectivity toward, likely, a reduced-gas, such as H2 in our present case. Our findings would be useful in exploring NDR to develop highly sensitive solid-state gas (ZnO-based) sensors of hydrogen and its related storage applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  The vast consumption of fossil fuels for meeting the energy demand has led to major unsustainable environmental concerns due to excessive greenhouse gas emissions warranting the identification and development of clean non-carbonaceous energy sources.1-5 In this regard, hydrogen has been identified as a clean, non-carbonaceous and potential energy source with superior energy density than currently adopted carbonaceous energy sources for meeting the global energy demand. However, efficient and economic production along with cost-effective storage and distribution of hydrogen utilizing the clean non-carbonaceous approach is of paramount importance before universal adoption of hydrogen as a clean energy source in the impending non-carbonaceous fuel economy. Along these lines, electricity driven water splitting (water electrolysis) is a frontrunner among other clean pollution free approaches for hydrogen production (having low carbon footprint). The commercial development of water electrolysis is thwarted due to the need of expensive and precious noble metals based electro-catalysts (Pt, IrO2) which exhibit excellent electro-catalytic activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid assisted proton exchange membrane (PEM) based water electrolysis. Hence, the identification and development of novel reduced noble metal containing electro-catalysts exhibiting excellent electro-catalytic activity and superior long term electrochemical stability similar/superior to state of the art OER electro-catalyst IrO2 in harsh and highly acidic operating conditions of OER, will aid in the reduction of capital cost of water electrolysis cells and thus, its progression towards commercialization.6.

 Abstract:  LiBH4 is considered as a prominent solid state hydrogen storage material with 18.3 wt% hydrogen storage capacity, while suffering sluggish dehydrogenation kinetics and poor reversibility.

 Abstract:  With hydrogen being seen as a key renewable energy vector, the search for materials exhibiting fast hydrogen transport becomes ever more important. Not only do hydrogen storage materials require high mobility of hydrogen in the solid state, but the effciency of electrochemical devices is also largely determined by fast ionic transport. Although the heavy alkaline-earth hydrides are of limited interest for their hydrogen storage potential, owing to low gravimetric densities, their ionic nature may prove useful in new electrochemical applications, especially as an ionically conducting electrolyte material. Here we show that barium hydride shows fast pure ionic transport of hydride ions (H-) in the high-temperature, high-symmetry phase. Although some conductivity studies have been reported on related materials previously, the nature of the charge carriers has not been determined.

 Abstract:  In this review, we discuss the evolution of localized surface plasmon resonance and surface plasmon resonance hydrogen sensors based on nanostructured metal hydrides, which has accelerated significantly during the past 5 years. We put particular focus on how, conceptually, plasmonic resonances can be used to study metal-hydrogen interactions at the nanoscale, both at the ensemble and at the single-nanoparticle level. Such efforts are motivated by a fundamental interest in understanding the role of nanosizing on metal hydride formation processes in the quest to develop efficient solid-state hydrogen storage materials with fast response times, reasonable thermodynamics, and acceptable long-term stability. Therefore, a brief introduction to the thermodynamics of metal hydride formation is also given. However, plasmonic hydrogen sensors not only are of academic interest as research tool in materials science but also are predicted to find more practical use as all-optical gas detectors in industrial and medical applications, as well as in a future hydrogen economy, where hydrogen is used as a carbon free energy carrier. Therefore, the wide range of different plasmonic hydrogen sensor designs already available is reviewed together with theoretical efforts to understand their fundamentals and optimize their performance in terms of sensitivity. In this context, we also highlight important challenges to be addressed in the future to take plasmonic hydrogen sensors from the laboratory to real applications in devices, including poisoning/deactivation of the active materials, sensor lifetime, and cross-sensitivity toward other gas species. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Herein, we have implemented an intimate grinding-mixing protocol (GMP) for the synthesis of a new hydrogelator from citrazinic acid and melamine. Sonication, just for a few seconds, of the ground mixture in a suitable solvent/mixed-solvent system finally results in the formation of a gel matrix. Citrazinic acid is decorated with ureidopyrimidone functionalities and melamine is enriched with aminopyridine functionalities. Therefore, the necessary non-covalent interactions (like hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking) become part-and-parcel of this reaction, bringing a nanofibrous gel material into existence. A thorough and complete solvent-dependent gelation investigation suggests that water must be present as the sole solvent or one of the members of other mixed-solvent systems to successfully result in gel formation. The gel shows an entangled network morphology. Different micro-analytical studies (FTIR, powder XRD, FESEM, TEM, rheology, etc.) have been conducted for complete characterization of the gel sample. The gel also exhibits stimuli-responsive behaviour towards different interfering chemical parameters like pH, selective anions, etc. Again, it is worth mentioning that here, GMP plays a key role in strongly initiating and improvising solid-state self-assembly. Different non-covalent interactions afford a suitable hydrogen-bonded motif which presumably propagates upon activation in solution phase after mild sonication, favouring the spontaneous formation of fibrous architectures. It is also noticed that without grinding, the solid-state interactions are jeopardized and only a partial gel structure prevails. Finally, the available porosity in the gel framework and the enriched π-electron density within the structure make the gel a suitable host for adsorption of guest molecules. This information provoked us to study the reversible adsorption-desorption equilibrium of molecular iodine within the dried-gel matrix. The guest iodine entrapment into the host occurs both from the solution and also from gas-phase iodine. The complete analysis suggests that our material presents a high storage capacity for this halogen species. Therefore, the study prescribes that the synthesized hydrogel material could be a suitable candidate for application in synthetic organic chemistry and would find an avenue to solve other environmental issues also. © 2015 Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  It was found that the procedures for incorporating hydrated salts into silica, including mixing with sol in an instant (S1 procedure), mixing with sol via drop by drop (S2 procedure) and mixing until the sol forming the gel (S3 procedure), had pronounced effects on the phase change enthalpy of hydrated salts/silica composite via sol-gel process. The discrepancy of phase change enthalpies of the composites with the same content of hydrated salts can be as high as 40 kJ/kg. To unveil the mechanism behind, the pore structure of silica matrix and interfacial functional groups were investigated extensively. It was revealed that different incorporation procedures resulted in distinct pore structure of silica matrix and different intensities of interfacial Si-OH groups. The S3 procedure was beneficial to induce the silica matrix with bigger pore size and fewer Si-OH groups. Consequently, the phase change enthalpy of the hydrated salts/silica composite prepared by this procedure was the highest because of its lower size confinement effects and weaker adsorption by Si-OH groups. This study will provide insight into the preparation of shape-stabilized phase change materials for thermal energy storage applications. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

 Abstract:  Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based on multidentate N-heterocyclic ligands involving imidazole, triazole, tetrazole, benzimidazole, benzotriazole or pyridine present intriguing molecular topologies and have potential applications in ion exchange, magnetism, gas sorption and storage, catalysis, optics and biomedicine. The 2-[(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)methyl]-1H-benzimidazole (tmb) ligand has four potential N-atom donors and can act in monodentate, chelating, bridging and tridentate coordination modes in the construction of complexes, and can also act as both a hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor. In addition, the tmb ligand can adopt different coordination conformations, resulting in complexes with helical structures due to the presence of the flexible methylene spacer. A new three-dimensional coordination polymer, poly[[bis(μ2-benzene-1,4-dicarboxylato)-κ4O1,O1':O4,O4';κ2O1:O4-bis{μ2-2-[(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)methyl-κN4]-1H-benzimidazole-κN3}dizinc(II)] trihydrate], {[Zn(C8H4O4)(C10H9N5)]·1.5H2O}n, has been synthesized by the reaction of ZnCl2 with tmb and benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (H2bdic) under solvothermal conditions. There are two crystallographically distinct bdic2- ligands [bdic2-(A) and bdic2-(B)] in the structure which adopt different coordination modes. The ZnII ions are bridged by tmb ligands, leading to one-dimensional helical chains with different handedness, and adjacent helices are linked by bdic2-(A) ligands, forming a two-dimensional network structure. The two-dimensional layers are further connected by bdic2-(B) ligands, resulting in a three-dimensional framework with the topological notation 66.

 Abstract:  Water finding, collection and retention are important issues in drylands because of the rareness and high evaporation of water. Efficiently and fully utilizing water for photocatalytic hydrogen production is thus a challenge in desert areas. Inspired by the decent water absorption and retention properties of super absorbent polymers (SAPs), it is a bracing idea to use SAPs for water storage and hydrogen production reactors to enable full use of precious water for light-driven water splitting. Herein, for the first time, we have prepared a self-assembling solid-state hydrogen source (SHS) for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In the SHS, Pt/TiO2 and NiB/CdS nanocomposites were used as solar-driven and visible-light driven hydrogen production model catalysts, respectively, integrated with commercial agricultural acrylamide-acrylate copolymerized crosslinked SAP (AAC). It exhibits hydrogen production comparable to that of a typical suspension system, is reusable, and can be more readily recycled than conventional powdery catalysts, because of its monolithic structure. All water molecules in the SHS can be used to produce hydrogen. Accordingly, the SHS developed in this work offers a strategy for integrating SAPs with catalysts that would be practical in water-efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in drought regions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

 Abstract:  A series of benzamide-based diphenyl maleimide derivatives 2a-d with strong crystallization-induced emission (CIE) activity were synthesized and investigated. 2a-d are almost non-emissive in solutions and amorphous films, but intensely and greenly emissive in crystalline powders and crystals with a quantum yield of 53% and 80%, respectively. The results of X-ray diffraction analysis and theoretical calculation demonstrate that the intramolecular hydrogen bond between C=O and NH groups formed in the excited state of 2 quenches the fluorescence, resulting from the rotation of benzamide groups in their solution and amorphous states. However, it would not happen in their crystalline sates for the locked conformation. Thus, the formation and inhibition of the hydrogen bonding in the excited state may be responsible for their CIE activity. Interestingly, the florescence of the 2d solid can be switched between on/off states by external stimuli including grind, heat, solvent vapor, and acid/alkali, which was utilized to develop three kinds of new technologies for rewritable information storage and security ink. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  The recent progress in ferroelectricity and antiferroelectricity in HfO2-based thin films is reported. Most ferroelectric thin film research focuses on perovskite structure materials, such as Pb(Zr,Ti)O3, BaTiO3, and SrBi2Ta2O9, which are considered to be feasible candidate materials for non-volatile semiconductor memory devices. However, these conventional ferroelectrics suffer from various problems including poor Si-compatibility, environmental issues related to Pb, large physical thickness, low resistance to hydrogen, and small bandgap. In 2011, ferroelectricity in Si-doped HfO2 thin films was first reported. Various dopants, such as Si, Zr, Al, Y, Gd, Sr, and La can induce ferroelectricity or antiferroelectricity in thin HfO2 films. They have large remanent polarization of up to 45 μC cm-2, and their coercive field (≈1-2 MV cm-1) is larger than conventional ferroelectric films by approximately one order of magnitude. Furthermore, they can be extremely thin (<10 nm) and have a large bandgap (>5 eV). These differences are believed to overcome the barriers of conventional ferroelectrics in memory applications, including ferroelectric field-effect-transistors and three-dimensional capacitors. Moreover, the coupling of electric and thermal properties of the antiferroelectric thin films is expected to be useful for various applications, including energy harvesting/storage, solid-state-cooling, and infrared sensors. Recent progress in ferroelectricity and antiferroelectricity in HfO2-based thin films is comprehensively reviewed.

 Abstract:  Various synthesis and rehydrogenation processes of lithium hydride (LiH) and magnesium amide (Mg(NH2)2) system with 8:3 molar ratio are investigated to understand the kinetic factors and effectively utilize the essential hydrogen desorption properties. For the hydrogen desorption with a solid-solid reaction, it is expected that the kinetic properties become worse by the sintering and phase separation. In fact, it is experimentally found that the low crystalline size and the close contact of LiH and Mg(NH2)2 lead to the fast hydrogen desorption. To preserve the potential hydrogen desorption properties, thermochemical and mechanochemical rehydrogenation processes are investigated. Although the only thermochemical process results in slowing the reaction rate due to the crystallization, the ball-milling can recover the original hydrogen desorption properties. Furthermore, the mechanochemical process at 150 °C is useful as the rehydrogenation technique to preserve the suitable crystalline size and mixing state of the reactants. As a result, it is demonstrated that the 8LiH and 3Mg(NH2)2 system is recognized as the potential hydrogen storage material to desorb more than 5.5 mass% of H2 at 150 °C. © 2015 by the authors.

 Abstract:  Solid-state hydrogen storage through the reversible formation of metallic hydrides is a key issue for the development of hydrogen as an energy vector. Herein we report the hydrogen storage performances of the KSiH3 phase ball-milled with NbF5 as a catalyst. The kinetics of hydrogen absorption/desorption are strongly enhanced by the addition of a catalyst as revealed by the large decrease of activation energies for both the absorption and desorption reactions. No disproportionation phenomenon is observed, indicating that the reaction between KSiH3 and KSi is perfectly reversible with a hydrogen storage capacity of 4.1 wt% H2. The thermodynamic properties of this KSi/KSiH3 equilibrium were investigated by plotting PCI curves from 90 °C to 130 °C: an enthalpy of 24.3 kJ mol-1 H2 and a low entropy change of 59.5 J K-1 mol-1 H2 are found. This low entropy variation is related to the high mobility of the H atoms in the α-KSiH3 phase as recently demonstrated by Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) experiments. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  The reorientational dynamics of crystalline MBH4 (M = Li-Cs) have been characterized with the interacting quantum atom theory. This interpretive approach enables an atomistic deciphering of the energetic features involved in BH4- reorientation using easily graspable chemical terms. It reveals a complex construction of the activation energy that extends beyond interatomic distances and chemical interactions. BH4- reorientations are in LiBH4 and NaBH4 regulated by their interaction with the nearest metal cation; however, higher metal electronic polarizability and more covalent M⋯H interactions shift the source of destabilization to internal deformations in the heavier systems. Underlying electrostatic contributions cease abruptly at CsBH4, triggering a departure in the otherwise monotonically increasing activation energy. Such knowledge concurs to the fundamental understanding and advancement of energy solutions in the field of hydrogen storage and solid-state batteries.

 Abstract:  Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a promising electrode material for flexible supercapacitors mainly because of its pseudocapacitive nature. Nevertheless, its practical applications are still plagued by its poor electrochemical cycling stability due to its low mechanical strength.

The flexible all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor from the ANFs/PEDOT:PSS film with an operating potential window of 0-1.6 V exhibits an energy density of 4.54 W h kg-1 and an excellent capacitance retention of 84.5% after 10 000 cycles at room temperature. Excitingly, the flexible device still displays an energy density of 3.83 W h kg-1 with a capacitance retention of 89.5% after 5000 cycles even at -20 °C. Moreover, the flexible device is found to be electrochemically stable under bending and twisting conditions, even sand striking, which could be ascribed to strong hydrogen bonding interaction between ANFs and PEDOT:PSS.

 Abstract:  Solid solutions of Cu(i)-containing oxide p-type semiconductors provide key opportunities to probe the fundamental relationships between chemical compositions and crystal structures, bandgap sizes, band energies, and photoelectrochemical properties. Members of the CuNb1-xTaxO3 (0 < x ≤ 0.25) solid solution have been synthesized via high temperature solid-state methods. The structure of CuNbO3 was found to be Cu-deficient Cu0.965NbO3 after heating in air at 250 °C for 3 hours, i.e., under similar conditions as those used to prepare it as a polycrystalline film. Powder X-ray diffraction techniques confirmed the purity of each composition up to x ≤ 0.25 and the lattice parameters were refined as the molar ratio of Nb(v) and Ta(v) was varied (a = 9.499 to 9.506 Å, b = 8.439 to 8.451 Å, c = 6.768 to 6.781 Å and β = 90.847 to 90.694°). An increase in the amount of Ta(v) yielded a small blue shift of the bandgap size from ∼1.89 eV to ∼1.97 eV for CuNb1-xTaxO3 from x = 0 to 0.25. Polycrystalline films of each member of the CuNb1-xTaxO3 solid solutions produced relatively comparable p-type photocurrents of up to -0.5 mA cm-2, while the stability of the cathodic photocurrent also remained similar with increasing Ta(v) content. Mott-Schottky analysis of CuNb1-xTaxO3 showed that the conduction band edge of -1.5 (vs. SHE) provides a sufficient overpotential (∼800 mV) to drive the reduction of water to hydrogen gas at the surface. The capability of the solid solutions to drive hydrogen production was confirmed through suspended particle photocatalysis. Further characterization of the CuNb0.91Ta0.09O3 composition included scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analyses. These data show that Cu(i) is oxidized to Cu(ii) as CuNb1-xTaxO3 is heated in air. Thus, the formation of Cu(ii) rich regions at the surface, together with the Ta(v) content, are found to play important roles in the stability and magnitude of the cathodic photocurrents produced under visible-light irradiation. Importantly, these results demonstrate that solid solution compositions can be used in films for solar energy conversion, notwithstanding their inherent atomic disorder. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

 Abstract:  In the present work we focus the attention on the phase structural transformations occurring upon the desorption process of the LiBH4 + LiAlH4 system. This study is conducted by means of manometric-calorimetric, in situ Synchrotron Radiation Powder X-ray Diffraction (SR-PXD) and ex situ Solid State Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements. The desorption reaction is characterized by two main dehydrogenation steps starting at 320 and 380 °C, respectively. The first step corresponds to the decomposition of LiAlH4 into Al and H2 via the formation of Li3AlH6 whereas the second one refers to the dehydrogenation of LiBH4 (molten state). In the range 328-380 °C, the molten LiBH4 reacts with metallic Al releasing hydrogen and forming an unidentified phase which appears to be an important intermediate for the desorption mechanism of LiBH4-Al-based systems. Interestingly, NMR studies indicate that the unknown intermediate is stable up to 400 °C and it is mainly composed of Li, B, Al and H. In addition, the NMR measurements of the annealed powders (400 °C) confirm that the desorption reaction of the LiBH4 + Al system proceeds via an amorphous boron compound. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Magnesium (Mg) is a light metal with relatively low cost. Its hydride (MgH2) is interesting for the safe hydrogen storage in solid state and has a high gravimetric capacity of 7.6%. Practical application of Mg is still hampered by high reaction temperatures and slow kinetics. In order to improve it and focus on more viable industrial processing conditions, Mg plates, with or without iron (Fe) addition, in the form of wires and powders, were submitted to severe plastic deformation (SPD) in air, starting with extensive cold rolling (ECR), followed by repetitive rolling (ARB). The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy (OM), scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). H2 storage properties were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Sievert's volumetric method. Mg processed by ECR+ARB resulted in larger grain refinement and densities of cracks than ECR. In addition, Fe in the form of continuous wires was fragmented and resulted in a better distribution of particles than powders, which agglomerated. Thus, finally, the synergetic effect of microstructural features and Fe as catalyst and its distribution improved activation, kinetics and hydrogen storage capacity. © 2017 Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos.

 Abstract:  Complex hydrides are a family of compounds which have attracted a lot of attention in the last decade for various clean energy-related purposes, from solid state hydrogen storage to materials suitable in Li-ion batteries. We present two new garnet-type borohydride materials suitable as solid state electrolytes. Li3K3Ce2(BH4)12 and Li3K3La2(BH4)12 show unexpectedly high room temperature Li+ ionic conductivity (compared to the reported isostructural garnet oxide Li-conductor) of σLi 3 × 10-7 and 6 × 10-7 S/cm with corresponding activation energies of Ea = 0.79 and Ea = 0.67 eV, respectively, which result from large bottleneck windows in the conduction path. The effect of heterovalent cation substitution is investigated as means of tailoring ionic conductivity. Doping with divalent Sr2+ and Eu2+ shows that σLi can be increased by one order of magnitude in the whole temperature range measured. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  Microporous zeolite-like aluminophosphate AlPO4-34 is a very promising material for water-adsorption-based thermal energy storage. To obtain better understanding of the dehydration of this material, a detailed variable-temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and first-principles calculation study was carried out. Unlike the previous studies, this one detected three distinct phase transitions during dehydration. The fully hydrated phase of AlPO4-34 first loses one water molecule per unit cell and transforms into the partly dehydrated phase I (space group P1). The molecule that was expelled first is the molecule that was initially located within the double six-membered ring and was very weakly coordinated to the aluminium atom and not involved in hydrogen bonds. During the second phase transition a water molecule is expelled from each chabazite cage. The obtained partly dehydrated phase II (space group P1) contains six water molecules in each chabazite cage and four water molecules coordinated to octahedral aluminium. The third transition leads to the completely dehydrated material. Structures of both partly dehydrated phases of AlPO4-34 were determined by the Rietveld method. Variable-temperature NMR and XRD detected very different phase-transition temperatures. This was due to very different sample packing, which significantly influenced the rate of water removal. The confirmation that the two techniques observed the same phases of AlPO4-34 was obtained by the first-principles calculations of NMR observables. Using the XRD-based structural models, the calculations predicted 31P and 27Al isotropic chemical shifts that agreed well with the observed ones. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 2016.

 Abstract:  In the last decade, alkaline and alkaline earth metal tetrahydroborates have been the focuses of the research due to their high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen densities. Among them, Ca(BH4)2 and the Ca(BH4)2 + MgH2 reactive hydride composites (RHC), were calculated to have the ideal thermodynamic properties which fall within the optimal range for mobile applications.

 Abstract:  A fiber-based multifunctional nickel phosphide (NiPx) electrode has been successfully prepared by facile electrodeposition of nickel nanoparticle arrays on a commercial carbon fiber (CF) followed by low-temperature phosphidation. As a result of the synergistic effect from the 3D porous structure, enhanced conductivity, and the two active components Ni2+ and Pδ- with rich valences, the resulting vertically aligned NiPx nanoflakes grown on the CF (CF@NiPx) electrode exhibit superior bifunctional electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in an alkaline electrolyte as well as an ultrahigh specific volumetric capacitance of 817 F cm-3 at a current density of 2 mA cm-2. For practical applications, an efficient CF@NiPx-based alkaline water electrolyzer, with strong durability, can achieve 10 mA cm-2 water-splitting current at a cell voltage of only 1.61 V (iR uncorrected). Besides, a fiber-based flexible solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor device with CF@NiPx as the cathode and reduced graphene oxide attached on CF@Ni (CF@Ni@RGO) as the anode was observed to achieve a remarkable volumetric energy density of 8.97 mW h cm-3, excellent flexibility and superior long term cycling stability.

"Seperate the questions with commasTitle:Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Hydrogen Diffusion in Aluminum
 Abstract:  Hydrogen diffusion impacts the performance of solid-state hydrogen storage materials and contributes to the embrittlement of structural materials under hydrogen-containing environments. In atomistic simulations, the diffusion energy barriers are usually calculated using molecular statics simulations where a nudged elastic band method is used to constrain a path connecting the two end points of an atomic jump. This approach requires prior knowledge of the ""end points"". For alloy and defective systems, the number of possible atomic jumps with respect to local atomic configurations is tremendous. Even when these jumps can be exhaustively studied, it is still unclear how they can be combined to give an overall diffusion behavior seen in experiments. Here we describe the use of molecular dynamics simulations to determine the overall diffusion energy barrier from the Arrhenius equation. This method does not require information about atomic jumps, and it has additional advantages, such as the ability to incorporate finite temperature effects and to determine the pre-exponential factor. As a test case for a generic method, we focus on hydrogen diffusion in bulk aluminum. We find that the challenge of this method is the statistical variation of the results. However, highly converged energy barriers can be achieved by an appropriate set of temperatures, output time intervals (for tracking hydrogen positions), and a long total simulation time. Our results help elucidate the inconsistencies of the experimental diffusion data published in the literature. The robust approach developed here may also open up future molecular dynamics simulations to rapidly study diffusion properties of complex material systems in multidimensional spaces involving composition and defects. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Abstract Mg-based hybrids have potential applications for hydrogen storage in the solid state. In the current investigation laminate hybrids were prepared keeping this objective in view. Mg2Ni was synthesized from vacuum induction melting of metal ingots, which was further incorporated between the Mg layers by Accumulative Roll Bonding process (ARB). To improve the hydrogen storage properties, carbon (soot/graphite) was also deposited between the Mg layers. By using the ARB process, microstructure refinement was achieved, along with the incorporation of about 5 wt.% Mg2Ni and 1.3 wt.% soot (or 5 wt.% graphite) in the hybrid. A total of 30 ARB passes were used in the process. The hydrogen absorption characteristics of the hybrid (through pressure-composition isotherms and absorption-time curves) were studied using a standard Sieverts apparatus. Absorption of about 6.2 wt.%H was observed at 300 °C at ∼3.5 bar pressure in the Mg-Mg2Ni-graphite hybrids (5.8 wt.%H at a plateau pressure of ∼2 bar). Good kinetics of absorption was also observed, i.e. 4.5 wt.%H was absorbed in ∼80 s at 300 °C under 20 bar H2 pressure. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Zr(BH4)4·8NH3 is considered to be a promising solid-state hydrogen-storage material, due to its high hydrogen density and low dehydrogenation temperature. However, the release of ammonia hinders its practical applications. To further reduce the dehydrogenation temperature and suppress ammonia release, here we investigated its hydrolysis process to evaluate its hydrogen generation performance. The results showed that the hydrolysis of Zr(BH4)4·8NH3 in water can generate about 1067 mL g-1 pure hydrogen in 240 min at 298 K without the release of diborane or ammonia impurity gases. With heat-assistance, the hydrogen generation rate can be significantly enhanced, and its activation energy was calculated to be 29.38 kJ mol-1. The hydrolysis mechanism was clarified.

 Abstract:  Solid-state reactions between sodium hydride and sodium hydroxide are unusual among hydride-hydroxide systems since hydrogen can be stored reversibly. In order to understand the relationship between hydrogen uptake/release properties and phase/structure evolution, the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation behavior of the Na-O-H system has been investigated in detail both ex- and in-situ. Simultaneous thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis coupled to mass spectrometry (TG-DTA-MS) experiments of NaH-NaOH composites reveal two principal features: Firstly, an H2 desorption event occurring between 240 and 380 °C and secondly an additional endothermic process at around 170 °C with no associated weight change. In-situ high-resolution synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction showed that NaOH appears to form a solid solution with NaH yielding a new cubic complex hydride phase below 200 °C. The Na-H-OH phase persists up to the maximum temperature of the in-situ diffraction experiment shortly before dehydrogenation occurs. The present work suggests that not only is the inter-phase synergic interaction of protic hydrogen (in NaOH) and hydridic hydrogen (in NaH) important in the dehydrogenation mechanism, but that also an intra-phase Hδ+... Hδ- interaction may be a crucial step in the desorption process. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

 Abstract:  Solid electrolytes are important part of all-solid state energy systems that store electrical energy on the chip. They allow a direct incorporation of micro-storage component with simple device architecture while operating at higher temperatures compared to liquid electrolytes. However, solid electrolytes are usually deposited at high temperatures, exceeding the thermal budget of current semiconductor technology. Herein, we report on the synthesis of high performance BaTiO3:H films as solid state electrolyte in which we incorporate protons during a room temperature RF sputtering process. Drastic changes occur on chemical, structural and electrical properties of the films when they accommodate highly mobile and reactive protons. BaTiO3:H films have well-defined crystalline phases and display an optical bandgap which decreases by increasing the HMR in the sputtering gas. In addition, these films show two relaxation processes. The first, thermally activated with an energy around 0.5 eV, emerges at low temperature due to the proton diffusion within the oxide material. The diffusion of positively charged oxygen vacancies by overcoming an energetic barrier of about 1.1 eV yields to a second relaxation which takes place at relatively high temperature. By using carbon nanowalls as high effective area bottom electrode, we anticipate a large specific capacitance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  The state of the art of conversion reactions of metal hydrides (MH) with lithium is presented and discussed in this review with regard to the use of these hydrides as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. A focus on the gravimetric and volumetric storage capacities for different examples from binary, ternary and complex hydrides is presented, with a comparison between thermodynamic prediction and experimental results. MgH2 constitutes one of the most attractive metal hydrides with a reversible capacity of 1480 mA·h·g-1 at a suitable potential (0.5 V vs Li+/Li0) and the lowest electrode polarization (<0.2 V) for conversion materials. Conversion process reaction mechanisms with lithium are subsequently detailed for MgH2, TiH2, complex hydrides Mg2MHx and other Mg-based hydrides. The reversible conversion reaction mechanism of MgH2, which is lithium-controlled, can be extended to others hydrides as: MHx + xLi+ + xe- in equilibrium with M + xLiH. Other reaction paths-involving solid solutions, metastable distorted phases, and phases with low hydrogen content-were recently reported for TiH2 and Mg2FeH6, Mg2CoH5 and Mg2NiH4. The importance of fundamental aspects to overcome technological difficulties is discussed with a focus on conversion reaction limitations in the case of MgH2. The influence of MgH2 particle size, mechanical grinding, hydrogen sorption cycles, grinding with carbon, reactive milling under hydrogen, and metal and catalyst addition to the MgH2/carbon composite on kinetics improvement and reversibility is presented. Drastic technological improvement in order to the enhance conversion process efficiencies is needed for practical applications. The main goals are minimizing the impact of electrode volume variation during lithium extraction and overcoming the poor electronic conductivity of LiH. To use polymer binders to improve the cycle life of the hydride-based electrode and to synthesize nanoscale composite hydride can be helpful to address these drawbacks.

 Abstract:  The structural and magnetic properties of polycrystalline Nd2NiMnO6 (NNMO) synthesized by solid state reaction method have been investigated. Rietveld refinement of Powder X-Ray diffraction data suggests that NNMO compound crystallizes in monoclinic phase with space group P21/n. Magnetic measurements reveal an additional magnetic transition TC׳~85 K due to to Ni3+–O–Mn3+ antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction along with ferromagnetic transition ~196 K in M–T curve, leading to antiferromagnetic interactions in this compound. High sintering temperature (upto 1100 °C) leads to the formation of antisite disorders and antiferromagnetic antiphase boundaries in the present sample. The magnetic hysteresis measurements show ferromagnetic behavior with low saturation magnetization value (~2 μB/f.u.) than the theoretical spin-only value (5 μB/f.u.) of Ni/Mn ions. Hence, antisite disorders diminish the long range ferromagnetic ordering and also affect the magnetic properties of this compound. Exchange bias behavior has been observed in the hysteresis loops when the sample was field cooled from 300 K to 5 K. Exchange coupling between the ferromagnetic moments and antiferromagnetic antiphase boundaries is responsible for the observation of exchange bias in the present system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

The MgH2-Na2Ti3O7 NT and MgH2-Na2Ti3O7 NR composites can desorb 6.5 wt% H2 within 6 min and 16 min at 300 °C, respectively, while the bulk MgH2 hardly releases any hydrogen even over a much longer time. In addition, isothermal rehydrogenation measurements show that the MgH2-Na2Ti3O7 NT composite can absorb 6.0 wt% H2 within 60 s at 275 °C and can even absorb 1.5 wt% H2 within 30 min at a temperature as low as 50 °C. TEM and HRTEM analyses indicate that the Na2Ti3O7 NTs are homogeneously distributed in MgH2, which catalyze the de-/rehydrogenation of MgH2 and meanwhile offer numerous diffusion channels to significantly accelerate the transportation of hydrogen atoms. Moreover, compared with bulk MgH2 and the MgH2-Na2Ti3O7 NR composite, the activation energy of the MgH2-Na2Ti3O7 NT composite is significantly decreased to 70.43 kJ mol-1. Such Na2Ti3O7 NTs with a unique morphology of the catalyst being distributed as nanotubes in MgH2 are believed to pave the way for the future design of hydrogen storage materials with excellent hydrogen storage performances. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Solid-state hydrogen storage using various materials is expected to provide the ultimate solution for safe and efficient on-board storage. Complex hydrides have attracted increasing attention over the past two decades due to their high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen densities. In this account, we review studies from our lab on tailoring the thermodynamics and kinetics for hydrogen storage in complex hydrides, including metal alanates, borohydrides and amides. By changing the material composition and structure, developing feasible preparation methods, doping high-performance catalysts, optimizing multifunctional additives, creating nanostructures and understanding the interaction mechanisms with hydrogen, the operating temperatures for hydrogen storage in metal amides, alanates and borohydrides are remarkably reduced. This temperature reduction is associated with enhanced reaction kinetics and improved reversibility. The examples discussed in this review are expected to provide new inspiration for the development of complex hydrides with high hydrogen capacity and appropriate thermodynamics and kinetics for hydrogen storage. © 2015 The Chemical Society of Japan & Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

 Abstract:  We report on a new class of complex hydrides: borohydride guanidinate complexes (MBH4·nCN3H5, M=Li, Mg, and Ca). They can be prepared via facile solid-state synthesis routes. Their crystal structures were successfully determined using a combination of X-ray diffraction, first-principles calculations and neutron vibrational spectroscopy. Among these compounds, Mg(BH4)2·6CN3H5 is composed of large complex Mg[CN3H5]62+ cations and surrounding BH4- ions, while Ca(BH4)2·2CN3H5 possesses layers of corner-sharing Ca[BH4]4(CN3H5)2 octahedra. Our dehydrogenation results show that ≈10 wt% hydrogen can be released from MBH4·nCN3H5 (M=Li, Mg, and Ca) at moderate temperatures with minimal ammonia and diborane contamination thanks to the synergistic effect of C-N bonds from guanidine and hydridic H from borohydrides leading to a weakening of the N-H bonds, thus impeding ammonia gas liberation. Further tuning the dehydrogenation with different cation species indicates that Mg(BH4)2·nCN3H5 can exhibit the optimum properties with nearly thermally neutral dehydrogenation and very high purity hydrogen release. © 2016

 Abstract:  Oxide electronic materials provide a plethora of possible applications and offer ample opportunity for scientists to probe into some of the exciting and intriguing phenomena exhibited by oxide systems and oxide interfaces. In addition to the already diverse spectrum of properties, the nanoscale form of oxides provides a new dimension of hitherto unknown phenomena due to the increased surface-to-volume ratio. Oxide electronic materials are becoming increasingly important in a wide range of applications including transparent electronics, optoelectronics, magnetoelectronics, photonics, spintronics, thermoelectrics, piezoelectrics, power harvesting, hydrogen storage and environmental waste management. Synthesis and fabrication of these materials, as well as processing into particular device structures to suit a specific application is still a challenge. Further, characterization of these materials to understand the tunability of their properties and the novel properties that evolve due to their nanostructured nature is another facet of the challenge. The research related to the oxide electronic field is at an impressionable stage, and this has motivated us to contribute with a roadmap on 'oxide electronic materials and oxide interfaces'. This roadmap envisages the potential applications of oxide materials in cutting edge technologies and focuses on the necessary advances required to implement these materials, including both conventional and novel techniques for the synthesis, characterization, processing and fabrication of nanostructured oxides and oxide-based devices. The contents of this roadmap will highlight the functional and correlated properties of oxides in bulk, nano, thin film, multilayer and heterostructure forms, as well as the theoretical considerations behind both present and future applications in many technologically important areas as pointed out by Venkatesan. The contributions in this roadmap span several thematic groups which are represented by the following authors: novel field effect transistors and bipolar devices by Fortunato, Grundmann, Boschker, Rao, and Rogers; energy conversion and saving by Zaban, Weidenkaff, and Murakami; new opportunities of photonics by Fompeyrine, and Zuniga-Perez; multiferroic materials including novel phenomena by Ramesh, Spaldin, Mertig, Lorenz, Srinivasan, and Prellier; and concepts for topological oxide electronics by Kawasaki, Pentcheva, and Gegenwart. Finally, Miletto Granozio presents the European action 'towards oxide-based electronics' which develops an oxide electronics roadmap with emphasis on future nonvolatile memories and the required technologies. In summary, we do hope that this oxide roadmap appears as an interesting up-to-date snapshot on one of the most exciting and active areas of solid state physics, materials science, and chemistry, which even after many years of very successful development shows in short intervals novel insights and achievements.

 Abstract:  The synthesis, isothermal section at 450 °C of the Li-Ge-H system in the concentration region from 40 at.% Li to 70 at.% Li and structural characterizations of the observed phases are reported. The hydrogenation and structural properties of the LiGeHx (0 < x < 0.25) phase were studied by volumetric analysis and X-ray diffraction.

The LiGeHx solid solution is formed by means of the insertion of hydrogen atoms into tetrahedral voids of parent LiGe structure.

 Abstract:  Current state-of-the-art methods consist of containing high-pressure compressed hydrogen in composite cylinders, with solid-state hydrogen storage materials an alternative that could improve on storage performance by enhancing volumetric densities. A new strategy that uses cryogenic temperatures to load hydrogen (cryocharging) is proposed and analysed in this work, comparing densities and final storage pressures for empty cylinders and containers with the high-surface area materials MIL-101 (Cr) and AX-21. Results show cryocharging as a viable option, as it can substantially lower the charging (at 77 K) and final pressures (at 298 K) for the majority of the cases considered. Kinetics are an equally important requirement for hydrogen storage systems, so the effective diffusivities at these conditions for both materials were calculated, and showed values comparable to the ones estimated in metal-organic frameworks and zeolites from quasielastic neutron scattering and molecular simulations. High-surface area materials tailored for hydrogen storage are a promising route for storage in mobile applications and results show that cryocharging is a promising strategy for hydrogen storage systems, since it increases volumetric densities and avoids energy penalties of operating at high pressures and/or low temperatures. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

 Abstract:  Abstract Understanding of surface interactions between borohydride molecules and the surfaces of porous supports have gained growing attention for successful development of nano-confinement engineering. By use of in situ variable temperature (VT) magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR, molecular mobility changes of LiBH4 crystalline solid has been investigated in the presence of silica based and carbonaceous surfaces. Spin-spin J-coupling of 1H-11B in LiBH4 was monitored in series of VT NMR spectra to probe translational mobility of LiBH4 that appeared to be greatly enhanced upon surface contact. Such enhanced diffusivity was found to be effective in the formation of solid solution and co-confinement with other metal borohydrides. Co-confinement of LiBH4-Ca(BH4)2 mixture was demonstrated at temperature as low as 100 °C, much lower than the reported bulk eutectic melting temperature.

 Abstract:  Dehydrogenation kinetics and reversibility of LiAlH4–LiBH4 doped with Ti-based additives (TiCl3 and Ti-isopropoxide), multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), and MWCNT impregnated with Ti-based additives are proposed. Reduction of dehydrogenation temperature as well as improvements of kinetics and reversibility, especially decomposition of thermodynamically stable hydride (LiBH4) is obtained from the samples doped with Ti-isopropoxide and MWCNT. This can be due to the fact that the formations of LixAl(1−x)B2 and LiH-Al containing phase during dehydrogenation favor decomposition of LiH, leading to increment of hydrogen capacity, and stabilization of boron in solid state, resulting in improvement of reversibility. Besides, the curvatures and thermal conductivity of MWCNT benefit hydrogen diffusion and heat transfer during de/rehydrogenation.

 Abstract:  The vast consumption of fossil fuels for meeting the energy demand has led to major unsustainable environmental concerns due to excessive greenhouse gas emissions warranting the identification and development of clean non-carbonaceous energy sources.1-5 In this regard, hydrogen has been identified as a clean, non-carbonaceous and potential energy source with superior energy density than currently adopted carbonaceous energy sources for meeting the global energy demand. However, efficient and economic production along with cost-effective storage and distribution of hydrogen utilizing the clean non-carbonaceous approach is of paramount importance before universal adoption of hydrogen as a clean energy source in the impending non-carbonaceous fuel economy. Along these lines, electricity driven water splitting (water electrolysis) is a frontrunner among other clean pollution free approaches for hydrogen production (having low carbon footprint). The commercial development of water electrolysis is thwarted due to the need of expensive and precious noble metals based electro-catalysts (Pt, IrO2) which exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid assisted proton exchange membrane (PEM) based water electrolysis. Hence, the identification and development of novel reduced noble metal containing electrocatalysts exhibiting excellent electro-catalytic activity and superior long term electrochemical stability similar/superior to state of the art OER electro-catalyst IrO2 in harsh and highly acidic operating conditions of OER, will aid in the reduction of capital cost of water electrolysis cells and thus, its progression towards commercialization.6 © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

 Abstract:  In the present work, proton exchange membrane (PEM) based on series of polybenzimidazole (PBI) composites are prepared with acidic surfactant like molecules (ASMs) with an objective to improve properties of PEM especially proton conductivity. Composites are obtained by homogenizing poly (4, 4′-diphenylether-5, 5′-bibenzimidazole) (OPBI) in three different ASMs namely camphorsulfonic acid (CSA), p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) and mono-n-dodecyl phosphate (MDP). FT-IR and solid-state NMR studies indicate the presence of interactions between OPBI and ASMs which are necessary for obtaining homogeneous composite membranes. Mechanical reinforcement is observed in case of composite membranes and storage modulus increases with increasing ASM loading in the composite. The detailed thermal analysis shows that phosphoric acid loaded (PA) composite membranes have higher thermal stability than the PA loaded pristine OPBI, it increases with increasing loading of ASM and it largely depends upon the type of ASM in the composite. Though OPBI is an amorphous polymer but ASMs self-organizes themselves in the polymer matrix owing to the strong interaction between OPBI and ASMs. As a result composite membranes display the crystalline character which in turn significantly influences the morphological features of the composites. Fibrillar to porous morphology are observed in composites depending on the type and loading of ASM. This morphological features and the crystalline nature of the composites are found to be responsible for mechanical reinforcement and significant increase in PA loading. The PA doped pristine OPBI, OPBI/CSA-20%, OPBI/PTSA-20% and OPBI/MDP-20% composite membranes proton conductivities are 8.6 × 10−2 S/cm, 2.82 × 10−1 S/cm, 1.71 × 10−1 S/cm and 1.43 × 10−1 S/cm, respectively at 180 °C. OPBI/ASM composite membranes also display very low acid leaching in comparison to pristine OPBI owing to the formation of strong interaction between PA and polymer chains through ASMs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

 Abstract:  This paper describes one-pot solution combustion synthesis of La2-xSbxO3 (0.02 ≤ x ≤ 0.10). Detailed characterization using Xray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelecron spectroscopy (XPS) is carried out to understand the doping effect and the oxidation state of antimony. Further, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) with CO2 is performed for evaluating the basic property and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) with H2 has been employed to obtain the oxygen storage capacity. The comparative study of La2O3, La2-xSbxO3 (0.02 ≤ x ≤ 0.10) shows that as the concentration of Sb increases, the basicity decreases and the oxygen storage capacity increases. Thus, nonreducible and basic La2O3 can be transformed to significantly reducible and acidic La2-xSbxO3 (0.02 ≤ x ≤ 0.10). Further, solid state UV spectroscopy shows that due to the antimony doping, band gap of La2O3 decreases significantly. Moreover, antimony doping also modifies the support property of La2O3 as demonstrated in the catalytic CO2 methanation reaction in the presence of hydrogen. Ru-doped La2O3 and La1.96Sb0.04O3 shows different selectivity toward methane formation and the later favors the reverse water gas shift reaction. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  A highly fluorescent emissive difluoroboron complex (TC) was designed, synthesized and characterized. The absolute fluorescence quantum yields of TC are 33.0% in the solid state and 26.0% in the solution state. The results of X-ray diffraction analysis demonstrate that the rigid structure, the intermolecular hydrogen bonding and the well-ordered as well as loose molecular packing are the major reasons for the high fluorescence emission. Moreover, the colors and fluorescence emission of TC can be switched by external stimuli including grinding and acids/bases. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) investigation verifies that the crystalline-amorphous state transformation between the original and ground states might be attributed to the mechanochromic luminescence properties. The high fluorescence emission and multi-stimuli-responsive fluorescence properties reveal that TC can be used as rewritable information storage, security ink and a fluorescence indicator for acids/bases. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  The solid-state solutions of NaHxF1-x (x = 1, 0.95, 0.85, 0.5) have been investigated to determine their potential for thermal energy applications. Thermal analyses of these materials have determined that an increase in fluorine content increases the temperature of hydrogen release, with a maximum rate of desorption at 443 °C for NaH0.5F0.5 compared to 408 °C for pure NaH, while pressure-composition-isotherm measurements have established a ΔHdes of 106 ± 5 kJ mol-1 H2 and ΔSdes of 143 ± 5 J K-1 mol-1 H2, compared to 117 kJ mol-1 H2 and 167 J K-1 mol-1 H2, respectively, for pure NaH. While fluorine substitution actually leads to a decrease in the stability (enthalpy) compared to pure NaH, it has a larger depressing effect on the entropy that leads to reduced hydrogen equilibrium pressures. In situ powder X-ray diffraction studies have ascertained that decomposition occurs via enrichment of fluorine in the NaHxF1-x composites while, unlike pure NaH, rehydrogenation is easily achievable under mild pressures. Further, cycling studies have proven that the material is stable over at least seven hydrogen sorption cycles, with only a slight decrease in capacity while operating between 470 and 520 °C. Theoretically, these materials may operate between 470 and 775 °C and, as such, show great potential as thermal energy storage materials for concentrating solar thermal power applications. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  An enediyne monomer is employed to prepare a microporous organic polymer through Bergman cyclization.

 Abstract:  Abstract Evaluation of the performances of hydrogen storage systems accommodating solid H storage materials should include characteristics on their reversible hydrogen storage capacity, operating pressures and temperatures, packing densities, and heat effects of hydrogen uptake and release. We have conducted a performance evaluation of the systems accumulating 5 kg of hydrogen in a containment of cylindrical geometry filled with a solid H storage material including such hydrides and reactive hydride composites as AlH3, MgH2, ""low-temperature"" (inter)metallic hydrides, NaAlH4, Na3AlH6, LiBH4 + MgH2, and MOFs. The analysis yielded gravimetric and volumetric H storage capacities, and energy efficiencies of hydrogen stores. We conclude that the weight efficiency of hydrogen stores, apart from the gravimetric H storage capacity of the material, is greatly affected by its packing density, and by the pressure-temperature conditions which determine type and dimensions of the containment. The materials with low heat effects of H exchange, operating close to the ambient conditions, should be targeted in the course of the development of new hydrogen stores as offering the best energy efficiency of their operation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Although major difficulties are experienced for hydrogen- storage materials to meet performance requirements for mobile applications, alternative fuel cell feedstocks such as ammonia can be stored in the solid state safely at high capacity. We herein describe the NiX2 -NH3 (X=Cl, Br, I) systems and demonstrate their exceptional suitability for NH3 storage (up to 43 wt % NH3 with desorption that begins at 400 K). The structural effects that result from the uptake of NH3 were studied by powder X-ray diffraction (PXD), FTIR spectroscopy and SEM. NH3 release at elevated temperatures was followed by in situ PXD. The cycling capabilities and air stability of the systems were also explored. NH3 is released from the hexaammines in a three-step process to yield the diammine, monoammine and NiX2 dihalides respectively and (re)ammoniation occurs readily at room temperature.

 Abstract:  Non-stoichiometry and bulk cation transport have been identified as key factors in the release and uptake of hydrogen in the Li-N-H system. Amide halide phases have been synthesized that have ionic conductivities several orders of magnitude greater than lithium amide, a faster rate of hydrogen release and elimination of the by-product, ammonia. Here we report the effect of both anion- and cation-doping on the hydrogen desorption properties of lithium amide, focusing in particular on how the presence of chloride anions and magnesium cations affects and controls the structure of the amide and imide compounds at the sub-nanometre level. Reducing the chloride content resulted in new low-chloride rhombohedral phases that contain around half of the chloride present in earlier amide chlorides, but maintained the enhancements seen in hydrogen desorption properties when compared to the halide-free system. These materials may also have potential in a range of other energy applications such as all solid state lithium ion batteries, supercapacitors, and CO2 capture and storage membranes. © 2015 Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology.

 Abstract:  A detailed understanding of hydrogen adsorption and diffusion in nanoporous solids is essential to design high density storage materials. A two level lattice model with a dynamics of thermally activated molecular jumps, inspired by experimental evidence on cubic nitroprussides, is proposed for solids with strongly and weakly bound states coexisting in nanopores. The model provides a simple, unified theoretical framework to study both the thermodynamics and kinetics of hydrogen adsorption desorption and to calculate, with minimum computational effort, quantities which can be directly compared to experimental results. In the linear and continuous limit, retarded diffusion is described by an integro differential equation and a frequency dependent diffusion coefficient. The transport diffusion coefficient shows a very strong loading dependence, with a high coverage behavior determined by intermolecular interactions. Desorption kinetics at constant external pressure and temperature is obtained from the analytical solution of the diffusion equation and compared to the results obtained from the numerical solution of nonlinear balance equations and from Monte Carlo simulations. The relevance of nonlinear, grain size, and fluctuations effects is discussed. Fluctuations inside pores lead to fast, subdiffusive growth of desorption times with grain size in the nanometric range. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Ammonia borane (AB), with high hydrogen contents and favorable dehydrogenation properties, is receiving intensive attention for its potential as a hydrogen storage material. In this study, we demonstrate a new type of solvent-free AB fuel system to obtain a high hydrogen systemic gravimetric capacity needed for practical fuel cell application. The new storage material constitutes AB soaked in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDE) with catalytic amounts of palladium nanoparticles. Notably, TEGDE is very essential for the successful preparation of AB fuel system in a semi-solid state. The use of a minimum amount of TEGDE in this system allows the hybrid AB catalytic system to be fabricated as an efficient solvent and catalytic reaction medium, enabling a high gravimetric and volumetric capacity. For practical applications, AB pellets with spherical shapes have been manufactured by the co-precipitation of AB/TEGDE/PdNPs, followed by the compression of semi-solid AB fuel mixture for fuel transfer from the fuel tank to the hydrogen generator. Consequently, this hybrid semi-solid state catalytic system exhibits a high gravimetric capacity of hydrogen [10.01 material weight%]. With a high hydrogen capacity, a high performance dehydrogenation is obtained because of the synergistic effects facilitated by the highly active PdNPs well-dispersed in a TEGDE medium. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014.

 Abstract:  Every year a large amount of ammonia is mechanically compressed with a low efficiency (∼65%) as an environmentally friendly chemical for fuel storage, transportation, food preservation and air conditioning. Electrochemical compression with a high efficiency (93%) offers an opportunity for substantial energy savings. But ammonia is never considered electrochemically compressible because of the known decomposition at high applied potentials. The concept of using a carrier gas to co-compress ammonia was proposed but never experimentally validated. Here for the first time, we realized electrochemical compression of ammonia by using a proton exchange membrane as an NH4+ conductor and hydrogen as a carrier to avoid decomposition. The ammonia transfer mechanism and kinetics in a Nafion membrane was investigated and verified using electro-analytical methods, and the continuous electrochemical ammonia compression at a constant voltage of 200 mV with a stable current density for 7 hours has been demonstrated. NH4+ transports in the Nafion membrane by hopping and vehicular mechanisms with a high NH4+ conductivity of 4 × 10-2 S cm-1 at 50% RH and 70 °C, and a constant transfer ratio of 2 between NH3 and H2 ensure a stable and high compression rate. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Mg and Zr are immiscible in the solid and liquid states and do not form any binary phases.

These supersaturated Mg-Zr phases, which did not decompose up to 773 K, exhibited reversible hydrogen storage capability at room temperature. They absorbed ∼1 wt.% of hydrogen under 9 MPa in ∼20 s and fully desorbed the hydrogen in the air. First-principles phonon calculations revealed that the disordered hcp and fcc solid solutions were dynamically stable in the whole composition range of the Mg-Zr system. The bcc or bcc-based ordered phases, which were formed only as intermediate phases during the phase transformation to the hcp solid solution alloy, were energetically higher and were dynamically stable only under limited conditions in the Mg-rich compositions. © 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

 Abstract:  Palladium and its alloys are model systems for studying the solid-state storage of hydrogen. Mechanical milling is commonly used to process complex powder systems for solid-state hydrogen storage; however, milling can also be used to evolve nanostructured powder to modify hydrogen sorption characteristics. In the present study, cryomilling (mechanical attrition milling in a cryogenic liquid) is used to produce nanostructured palladium-rhodium alloy powder. Characterization of the cryomilled Pd-10Rh using electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and surface area analysis reveal that (i) particle morphology evolves from spherical to flattened disk-like particles; while (ii) crystallite size decreases from several microns to less than 100 nm; and (iii) dislocation density increases with increased cryomilling time. Hydrogen absorption and desorption isotherms as well as the time scales for absorption were measured for cryomilled Pd-10Rh, and correlated with observed microstructural changes induced by the cryomilling process. In short, as the microstructure of the Pd-10Rh alloy is refined by cryomilling: (i) the maximum hydrogen concentration in the α-phase increases, (ii) the pressure plateau becomes flatter and (iii) the equilibrium hydrogen capacity increases at pressure of 101.3 kPa. Additionally, the rate of hydrogen absorption was reduced by an order of magnitude compared to non-cryomilled (atomized) powder. © 2014, Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  Structural evolution of turbostratic carbon samples as a function of annealing temperature has been investigated in detail using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Raman spectroscopic techniques. From these studies, it is established that, samples heated at lower temperatures (700 °C and 800 °C) consist carbon particles with rough surfaces forming structure of surface fractal in nature. Whereas the sample heated at higher temperature (900 °C) consists of larger clusters with nearly smooth surface as well as smaller size particles forming dense mass fractal structure. For this sample, solid state NMR and Raman Spectroscopic studies indicate an increased extent of overlapping of 2pz orbital of carbon atoms due to improved long range ordering and clustering. Hydrogen adsorption studies further substantiated that energetically more homogeneous surface exists for particles of 900 °C heated sample as compared to those of 700 °C and 800 °C heated samples. A highest hydrogen storage capacity of 0.152 H/M has been observed at 123 K and 45 bar pressure for the sample heated at 900 °C. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS

 Abstract:  Ammonia has been proposed as an indirect hydrogen carrier, as solid-state ammonia-storage could be easier than directly absorbing hydrogen in materials. Here we investigate the structural evolution of hyper-ammoniated lithium fullerides (ND3)yLi6C60 during ammonia desorption, using in-situ high intensity neutron powder diffraction. In (ND3)yLi6C60, ammonia molecules are stored in their neutral state inside the inter-fullerene interstices and are coordinated to the intercalated Li ions, forming Li-ND3 clusters. Li6C60 is found to absorb up to 36.8 wt% ND3, which corresponds to approximately 14 ammonia molecules per C60. The ammonia release, studied either in-situ or ex-situ by means of manometric analyses and differential scanning calorimetry, takes place in two main steps, at 350-410 K and 500-540 K, respectively. This corresponds to two clear 1st order structural phase transitions and the absorption process is partially reversible. These findings suggest that the system could be a good candidate for ammonia-storage applications. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Metal hydrides (MHx) have been in focus for a long time as one of several alternatives to store hydrogen in a hydrogen-based economy [1-14]. These materials, which reversibly absorb and desorb hydrogen at ambient temperature and pressure, so-called “hydrogen storage alloys,” are regarded as important materials for solving energy and environmental issues. Two other alternatives are high-pressure gas containers and liquid hydrogen. In metal hydrides, one uses the fact that hydrogen uptake in certain metals is exothermic and furthermore allows saturation uptakes that are close to, or may even exceed, that of liquid hydrogen. Researchers hope to use these compounds as a basis for storing hydrogen at higher densities than in pressurized tanks. © 2018 Pan Stanford Publishing Pte. Ltd.

 Abstract:  While the possibility to create a single-atom-thick two-dimensional layer from any material remains, only a few such structures have been obtained other than graphene and a monolayer of boron nitride. Here, based upon ab initio theoretical simulations, we propose a new stable graphenelike single-atomic-layer Si2BN structure that has all of its atoms with sp2 bonding with no out-of-plane buckling. The structure is found to be metallic with a finite density of states at the Fermi level. This structure can be rolled into nanotubes in a manner similar to graphene. Combining first- and second-row elements in the Periodic Table to form a one-atom-thick material that is also flat opens up the possibility for studying new physics beyond graphene.

 Abstract:  Boron nano-clusters of various shapes and sizes have potential applications asscintillating detector and hydrogen storage material. Using time dependent densityfunctional theory (TDDFT) as implemented in CASIDA we have studied the linear opticalabsorption spectra for boron clusters Bn (n = 2–5) and compared withpreviously reported results using Hatree-Fock (H-F) based method where the spectrum islimited to 8 eV due to exclusion of excitation into very high energy unoccupied orbital.The optical spectra fall in the visible and near UV region and are very much dependent onthe shape of the isomer. We have obtained additional peaks for B2 linear, B3 triangular, B4 rhombus and square shapedisomers beyond 8 eV which were missing in the previous H-F based study and hassignificance as they fall below the ionization potential. We correlate the opticalspectrum with the shape of the Kohn-Sham orbitals and HUMO-LUMO gap and assess comparativestability of various Bn (n = 2–5) clusters in termsof HUMO-LUMO gap, bond-length and relative energy.

 Abstract:  The structural behavior of the tetragonal NdBaMn2O5 phase, a member of the family of A-site ordered layered manganites that have been recently suggested as possible mixed ionic and electronic conductors, has been investigated by means of in situ neutron powder diffraction. Considering applications in energy production and storage devices and use of NdBaMn2O5+δ as an electrode in symmetrical cells, the study was carried out in relevant atmosphere conditions, i.e. dilute hydrogen (wet and dry) and dry air in the temperature range 25-800 °C. Neutron data under flowing hydrogen allowed monitoring of the structural phase transition from the charge-ordered to the charge-disordered state as a function of temperature. Slow reduction of the fully oxidised phase, NdBaMn2O6, previously formed from quick oxidation of the pristine material, enabled real-time observation of the intermediate NdBaMn2O5.5 phase and its crystal characterization up to 700 °C in the course of its conversion to NdBaMn2O5. Oxygen vacancy ordering within the Nd layers of NdBaMn2O5.5 correlated with antiferrodistortive orbital ordering of the Jahn-Teller Mn3+ ion in the square pyramids and octahedra results in large thermal expansion and relatively slow anisotropic oxygen diffusion occurring in the NdO layer. The four heating/cooling cycles evidenced no oxygen miscibility between the three distinct phases detected in the NdBaMn2O5+δ system with δ ∼ 0, 0.5 and 1 and clearly demonstrated that reversible oxygen intercalation/deintercalation underpins the phase stability of the LnBaMn2O5+δ materials to redox cycling and to wet atmosphere in high temperature electrochemical devices. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

 Abstract:  The semi-solid flow battery (SSFB) is a promising storage energy technology featured by employing semi-solid fluid electrodes containing conductive additive and active Li-ion battery materials. The state of art anode material for SSFB is Li4Ti5O12 (LTO). This work shows that LTO improves drastically the performance in fluid electrode via hydrogen annealing manifesting the importance of the electrical conductivity of the active material in SSFBs. On the other hand, the properties of fluid electrodes allow the contributions of ionic and electrical resistance to be separated in operando. The asymmetric overpotential observed in Li4Ti5O12 and TiO2 is proposed to originate from the so-called electron bottleneck mechanism based on the transformation from electrically insulator to conductor upon (de-)lithiation, or vice versa, which should be considered when modelling, evaluating or designing advanced materials based on Li4Ti5O12, TiO2 or others with insulating-conducting behavior materials. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

 Abstract:  Selective laser melting is a promising process for the production of metallic parts with tailored geometries. However, this process is only resource-friendly, if powders are used several times. Until now, it is not fully understood, how recycling or long-time storage of metallic powders influence the properties of 3D printed metals. This work examines the change of carbon, sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen concentrations with long-time storage or multiple usages. Elemental analysis was applied for the determination of carbon, sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen concentrations in metallic powders, as this analytical method is highly accurate, fast and easy to use. Results are more precise and detection limit is lower compared to any other analytical method. However, until now it is impossible to analyze carbon, sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen via one single elemental analyzer. This work describes an innovative, fully automated and energy efficient solution for the determination of all five elements carbon, sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen via one single elemental analyzer. For the first time, this is achieved by the application of an solid-state induction furnace for both CS and ONH analysis. Extreme temperatures of around 3000 °C, which can be necessary for ONH analysis, are realized by an innovative construction design. Moreover, the new crucible geometry for combustion method results in reduced spatter and minimized dust in the system, which is discussed in terms of maintenance, lifetime and data accuracy. It was observed, that carbon concentration increases in iron-based metals with more usages and oxygen concentration is higher for longer stored powders. Similar trends are observed for titanium- and cobalt-based powders. The influence of the change in elemental concentration on properties of 3D printed parts is discussed.

 Abstract:  The exploration of favourable hydrogen storage materials is of great importance for the realization of a sustainable hydrogen energy society. Here, we report a hydrogen-induced glass-to-glass transition in Mg-based metallic glasses (MGs) with a storage capacity as high as 5 wt%-H. The hydrogen storage capacity of metallic glassy hydrides (MGHs) is obviously higher than that of their crystalline counterparts owing to the free volume and disordered atomic structure associated with glasses. The glass-to-glass transition is demonstrated by direct experimental observation using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Remarkably, the dehydrogenation temperature of the MGHs can be efficiently tuned as it shows a close relationship with the enthalpy of mixing between the alloying element and hydrogen, and can be decreased from ∼350 °C to ∼150 °C when alloying with 5 at.%-Cu. MGs therefore have great potential as solid-state hydrogen storage materials. © 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

 Abstract:  Abstract The reaction of lithium amide and imide with lithium halides to form new amide halide or imide halide phases has led to improved hydrogen desorption and absorption properties and, for the amides, lithium ion conductivities. Here we investigate the effect of bromide incorporation on the ionic conductivity and hydrogen absorption properties of lithium nitride.

Powder X-ray diffraction showed the formation of Li2Br(NH2) and LiBr, and Raman spectroscopy confirmed that only amide anions were present and that the hydrogen uptake reaction had gone to completion. The lithium ion conductivity of Li6NBr3 at the hydrogenation temperature was found to be less than that of Li3N, which may be a significant factor in the kinetics of the hydrogenation process. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Storage of renewable energy remains a significant challenge for the implementation of a future carbon neutral and sustainable society based on renewable energy. New technologies providing a paradigm shift for energy storage may likely be based on novel materials with new functionalities. This review provides new perspectives for rational design of functional materials for energy storage using dynamic, disorder or entropy effects as a design concept. These effects may be introduced into the solid state using complex anions such as BH4- or B12H122-. These dynamic effects may facilitate anion substitution and preparation of materials that may stabilize high temperature polymorphs at lower temperatures. This has provided new ion conductors for lithium batteries and perovskite type metal borohydrides, which can be modified to resemble the well-known useful metal halide photovoltaics.

 Abstract:  The interest in Mg-based hydrides for solid state hydrogen storage is associated to their capability to reversibly absorb and desorb large amounts of hydrogen.

The pellets exhibited good kinetic performance and durability, even if the pressure of compaction revealed to be an important parameter for their mechanical stability.

 Abstract:  In the near future, ships will need more efficient power generation technologies for auxiliary power supply than those used currently. In the project SchiffsIntegration BrennstoffZelle (SchIBZ), a fuel cell system is being developed to increase the electrical efficiency of on-board power supply systems. In order to avoid the limitation of hydrogen storage, the on-site fuel processing of hydrocarbons offered an opportunity for the hydrogen supply of fuel cell systems to be operated in remote locations. As fuel standard European road diesel was processed with the process of adiabatic prereforming, a steam-reforming derivate. A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) was coupled with this fuel processor and was fed with standard European diesel fuel. Two flexible test rigs were developed to test the fuel processor and the SOFC either combined or independently. During combined operation, the SOFC modules were fed with feedstock gas from the fuel processor, which ran on standard European diesel fuel. Combined operation of both test rigs at steady state was achieved for more than 1000 h. For the whole experimental runtime, the fuel processor delivered sufficient feedstock quality for the SOFC, and no significant voltage degradation (about 0.5 %) of the SOFC modules was observed over 1000 h of operation. This low value of degradation is known for the operation of SOFC with pure hydrogen and methane without impurities. Copyright © 2015 by ASTM International.

 Abstract:  Although increased number of reports in recent years on proton exchange membrane (PEM) developed from nanocomposites of polybenzimidazole (PBI) with inorganic fillers brought hope to end the saga of contradiction between proton conductivity and variety of stabilities, such as mechanical, thermal,chemical, etc.; it still remains a prime challenge to develop a highly conducting PEM with superior aforementioned stabilities. In fact the very limited understanding of the interactions especially interfacial interaction between PBI and inorganic filler leads to confusion over the choice of inorganic filler type and their surface functionalities. Taking clue from our earlier study based on poly(4,4′-diphenylether-5,5′-bibenzimidazole) (OPBI)/silica nanocomposites, where silica nanoparticles modified with short chain amine showed interfacial interaction-dependent properties, in this work we explored the possibility of enhanced interfacial interaction and control over the interface by optimizing the chemistry of the silica surface. We functionalized the surface of silica nanoparticles with a longer aliphatic chain having multiple amine groups (named as long chain amine modified silica and abbreviated as LAMS). FTIR and 13C solid-state NMR provided proof of hydrogen bonding interactions between the amine groups of modifier and those of OPBI. LAMS nanoparticles yielded a more distinguished self-Assembly extending all over the OPBI matrix with increasing concentrations. The crystalline nature of these self-Assembled clusters was probed by wide-Angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) studies and the morphological features were captured by transmission electron microscope (TEM). We demonstrated the changes in storage modulus and glass transition temperature (Tg) of the membranes, the fundamental parameters that are more sensitive to interfacial structure using temperature dependent dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). All the nanocomposite membranes displayed enhanced mechanical, thermal and chemical stability than neat OPBI. The lower water uptake and swelling ratio and volume in both acid and water reflected the more hydrophobic characteristic of the nanocomposites. All the nanocomposite membranes showed phosphoric acid (PA) values to be higher than OPBI but the levels showed decreasing trend with increasing silica content; the reason attributed to the interparticle interaction. The self-Assembled clusters of LAMS nanoparticles in the matrix created more sites for proton hopping as a result of which the proton conductivity of all the nanocomposites displayed an increasing trend. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Record greenhouse gas emissions have spurred the search for clean energy sources such as hydrogen (H2) fuel cells. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising H2 adsorption and storage media, but knowledge of H2 dynamics and adsorption strengths in these materials is lacking. Variable-temperature (VT) 2H solid-state NMR (SSNMR) experiments targeting 2H2 gas (i.e., D2) shed light on D2 adsorption and dynamics within six representative MOFs: UiO-66, M-MOF-74 (M = Zn, Mg, Ni), and α-M3(COOH)6 (M = Mg, Zn). D2 binding is relatively strong in Mg-MOF-74, Ni-MOF-74, α-Mg3(COOH)6, and α-Zn3(COOH)6, giving rise to broad 2H SSNMR powder patterns. In contrast, D2 adsorption is weaker in UiO-66 and Zn-MOF-74, as evidenced by the narrow 2H resonances that correspond to rapid reorientation of the D2 molecules. Employing 2H SSNMR experiments in this fashion holds great promise for the correlation of MOF structural features and functional groups/metal centers to H2 dynamics and host-guest interactions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

 Abstract:  In the quest of new renewable sources of energy, hydrogen is a promising candidate and its storage in solid-state materials is of extreme importance. Beryllium has been invoked in the past for this purpose because of its low density, and for the rather low energy of adsorption and retention of hydrogen that makes its restitution relatively easy, therefore it seems interesting to also investigate the properties of beryllium oxide. Hydrogen (and its isotopes) is also important as the fuel of deuterium-tritium plasma in tokamaks for energy production by magnetically confined nuclear fusion, when the plasma is in interaction with the beryllium (and beryllium oxide) of the inner walls of the device. Another interest of beryllium oxide (BeO) lies in its properties as a ceramic: high thermal conductivity, high electric resistivity, efficient accumulation of energy, and transparency to a large spectrum of radiations. The bad point is that beryllium oxide grows very easily as a film on pure beryllium sample and significantly perturbs the material properties on the surface in a manner that is not easy to comprehend. The dynamics of hydrogen atom retention in beryllium oxide implies the knowledge of its interactions of the atoms constituting the material, on the surface and in the bulk and in the defects present into this media. These defects can be native or generated by the hydrogen beam. This paper proposes a detailed calculation of energy trapping and diffusivity of interstitial atoms (hydrogen, beryllium, oxygen). Then the same kind of computations is described for atomic vacancies and the trapping of hydrogen atoms into these vacancies. The last step deals with the surfaces of beryllium oxide, their structures and reactivity to hydrogen. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Ammonia borane is a promising hydrogen storage material due to its high gravimetric capacity (19.6%wt), but it also presents limitations such as a slow hydrogen release with a long induction time, a difficult regeneration, or the formation of foams and gaseous by-products during thermolysis. Previous studies have shown that by nanoconfinement of ammonia borane within a porous support some of these limitations can be overcome due to the reduction and stabilization of ammonia borane particle size. However, this effect was only observed with moderate ammonia borane loadings, as with higher loadings the pores of the support became obstructed. In this work, silica aerogels produced by CO2 drying, with pore volumes up to 2 cm3/g, have been used to confine ammonia borane. The influence of the amount of ammonia borane loaded on the aerogel support on the thermal and structural properties of the material has been analyzed. It has been found that more than 60 wt% of ammonia borane can be effectively stored in the pores of the aerogel support. The resulting material shows faster hydrogen release kinetics by thermolysis at 80 °C, due to a significant reduction in the mea size of ammonia borane after confinement and the participation of SiOH and SiOSi groups of silica aerogel in the decomposition mechanism. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

 Abstract:  Mg(BH4)2 contains 14.9 mass% of hydrogen and is considered as a promising hydrogen storage material.

 Abstract:  Micro-supercapacitors are promising energy storage devices that can complement or even replace batteries in miniaturized portable electronics and microelectromechanical systems. Their main limitation, however, is the low volumetric energy density when compared with batteries. Here, we describe a hierarchically structured carbon microfibre made of an interconnected network of aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes with interposed nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide sheets. The nanomaterials form mesoporous structures of large specific surface area (396 m 2 g-1) and high electrical conductivity (102 S cm-1). We develop a scalable method to continuously produce the fibres using a silica capillary column functioning as a hydrothermal microreactor. The resultant fibres show a specific volumetric capacity as high as 305 F cm-3 in sulphuric acid (measured at 73.5 mA cm-3 in a three-electrode cell) or 300 F cm-3 in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/H 3 PO 4 electrolyte (measured at 26.7 mA cm-3 in a two-electrode cell). A full micro-supercapacitor with PVA/H 3 PO 4 gel electrolyte, free from binder, current collector and separator, has a volumetric energy density of ∼6.3 mWh cm-3 (a value comparable to that of 4 V-500 μAh thin-film lithium batteries) while maintaining a power density more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of batteries, as well as a long cycle life. To demonstrate that our fibre-based, all-solid-state micro-supercapacitors can be easily integrated into miniaturized flexible devices, we use them to power an ultraviolet photodetector and a light-emitting diode. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

 Abstract:  Frequency domain analysis of the hydrogen storage kinetics was performed by Fourier transformation of the point relaxation data monitored for a pressure-composition isotherm (PCI) of Mg/MgH2 system at 325 C. The correlated hydrogen flux and the pressure relaxation under constant-volume conditions in a typical Sievert's type setup leads to the presence of the characteristic inductive loop, the size of which corresponds to R parameter for RC transmission line model for diffusion in the spherical geometry, while the theoretical dc limit resistance may not indicate the diffusion contribution only. The kinetic information was shown equivalent to that of time-domain analysis based on the diffusion problem of a solute in a limited amount into solid state from a well-stirred medium [J. Phys. Chem. C 2013, DOI: 10.1021/jp401286b]. The spectra further develop into the oscillating trajectories originating from the truncation in the sampling. The essential experimental features can be simulated by a RL two-rail transmission line model. A parametric analysis of the preoscillation spectral range using ideal lumped elements provided information on the exponential relaxation constants, nucleation/surface reaction in the two-phase region, and the sampling periods as well as the diffusivity. The pneumatochemical immittance spectroscopy (PnIS) developed in the present work allows a fully automated hydrogen storage kinetic analysis with visualized R and C parameters for the estimation of chemical diffusivity as a function of storage state using the relaxation data measured for PCI by conventional Sievert's apparatuses. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Magnesium hydride is one of the most promising candidates for solid-state hydrogen storage and thermal energy storage applications. The effects of V-based solid solution alloys on the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation behavior of magnesium hydride are studied. Significant reduction of the dehydrogenation temperature and improvements of the kinetics of both absorption and desorption reactions were observed for MgH2with V-based additives. Those observations were made using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pressure-composition-temperature (PCT) techniques. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements suggest that the additives functioned as catalysts during the reactions. The comparison of the characteristics of different additives suggested that the hydrogen equilibrium pressures of those additives themselves have a significant bearing on their effects on the kinetic behaviors of MgH2. The lower is the stability of an additive as a hydride, the more effective it would be as a catalyst. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  On-board hydrogen storage is a critical issue to realize the so-called hydrogen economy that is potential to solve the challenges of energy and environment. Hydrogen stored in solid state materials is a promising method to be able to achieve the on-board applications due to its advantages of high density and safety issues. However, the challenges of high temperature and slow kinetics of hydrogen release must be addressed. Fundamentally, the temperature of hydrogen release is directly dependent on the enthalpy of the reaction. It is demonstrated that the previous approaches such as ball milling with catalysts can significantly enhance the hydrogen release rate but influence very little the thermodynamics (the enthalpy). In this talk, we report some recent research results on hydrogen storage materials (magnesium, complex hydrides and ammonia borane) confined in porous templates. It is confirmed that the hydrogen desorption temperature can be significantly decreased, which means the thermodynamics of hydrogen release reactions can be altered through nanoconfinement. © OSA 2013.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen storage in MgH 2 is strongly limited by kinetic constraints, so that several additives have been considered in order to improve the rate of hydrogen desorption. The present work is devoted to investigate the effect of BaRuO 3 addition on hydrogen absorption and desorption properties of MgH 2. BaRuO 3 was prepared by solid-state synthesis of BaO and Ru in oxidizing environment. The interaction of as-prepared BaRuO 3 with hydrogen at room temperature was examined by thermal desorption and X-ray diffraction experiments, showing that BaRuO 3 has the ability to uptake hydrogen in the bulk. The hydrogen interaction is discussed with respect to octahedral ruthenium local environment present in the oxide structure. Addition of 1 mol.% BaRuO 3 to MgH 2 was performed by ball milling. Hydrogen desorption properties were investigated by Sievert and DSC, connected with a H 2 detector. The H 2 desorbed from of the nano-structured materials is lower than the theoretical content in MgH 2, due to the presence of a non-reactive MgO layer. A remarkable increase of the H 2 desorption kinetics in nano-structured MgH 2 was observed with respect to bare MgH 2. The activation energy for hydrogen desorption from MgH 2/BaRuO 3 mixture was estimated by Arrhenius and Kissinger methods and a value around 130 kJ mol -1 and 90 kJ mol -1 was obtained, respectively. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

As the second largest class of quasicrystals, titanium-based icosahedral quasicrystals are very promising for hydrogen storage applications owing to their inherent abundant interstitial sites and favorable hydrogen-metal chemistry.

When the molar ratio of Sc addition is under 1%, a maximum discharge capacity of about 270 mA h g-1 can be delivered. With further increasing Sc amount to 6%, good cycling stability as well as significantly retarded self-discharge rate (capacity retention 94% after 24 h relaxation) is observed.

 Abstract:  Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-sugar composites have been investigated as cost effective shape-stabilized phase change materials for thermal energy storage. PEGs form internal hydrogen bonds stabilizing their chains at solid state. However low molecular weight PEGs are liquid due to short chains as high molecular weight PEGs have too little concentration of hydroxyl groups. Therefore, glucose, fructose, and lactose are used as hydrogen bond source in this study. Consequently it is found that sugars stabilized PEGs up to 90% PEG constitution in solid state except for 90%PEG10,000/10% fructose blend. Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) analysis revealed considerable interactions between PEGs. The maximum changes in the spectra were observed in the OH stretching region as band broadening due to increasing hydrogen bonding interactions. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis are used to determine phase change temperatures and enthalpy of the shape-stabilized composites that are slightly lower than those of PEG precursors due to the interference effect of sugar in crystallization process. The enthalpies of the blends are 89%, 95%, and 94% of expected from 90%PEG/10% glucose blends, 93%, 94%, and 93% of expected from 90% PEG/10% fructose blends, and 99%, 96%, and 96% of expected from 90% PEG/10% lactose blends respectively when PEGs with 1,000; 6,000; and 10,000 g/mol average molecular weights are used respectively.

 Abstract:  Point relaxations for the pressure-composition isotherms were analyzed as a solid-state diffusion problem of hydrogen solutes from the gas phase provided in a limited amount by a pulse-like supply. For the large differential hydrogen storage, typical in the PCI plateau region, represented by small effective volume ratio λ parameter in the diffusion equation, the relaxation occurs much faster than in the galvanostatic or potentiostatic relaxations for the same chemical diffusivity values. The analysis was successfully applied to Mg/MgH2 system and the apparent chemical diffusivity and the hydrogen self-diffusivity were evaluated as a function of the state of hydrogen storage, in an analogous manner to the well-known electrochemical titration techniques. The increase in the apparent chemical diffusivity and hydrogen self-diffusivity in the plateau region with the increasing state of storage can be consistently explained by the lower hydrogen self-diffusivity in MgH2 than in Mg solid solution. The hydrogen self-diffusivity variation in the single phase MgH2 region suggests the vacancy mechanism.

 Abstract:  Molecular stability of racemic 4-O-benzyl-myo-inositol-1,3,5-orthoformate, an early intermediate during the synthesis of phosphoinositols, depends on the phase in which it is stored. This orthoformate is stable when stored in the crystalline form or as solution in common organic solvents. The former has eluded chemists since the preparation of this benzyl ether two decades ago. The difficulty in obtaining crystals of this orthoformate is due to the cleavage of the orthoformate moiety during storage in the gummy state. Dimorphs (form I and form II) of crystalline racemic 4-O-benzyl-myo-inositol-1,3,5-orthoformate, were obtained when the gummy sample was stored over extended periods of time.

Moreover, solid-state 11B NMR measurements were employed to illustrate the different reaction mechanisms in these two PSDB-confined AB samples, where decomposition involving both the diammoniate of diborane (DADB) and linear dimer are observed for PSDB-AB (NH 3) but only the latter route is seen for PSDB-AB (CH 3OH), deeply demonstrating the difference of dehydrogenation properties in these two samples. Our findings establish a prospective approach via utilizing this class of polymers for promoting the design and construction of advanced energy materials with high performances. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterization (chemical, structural, and thermal) of a new crystal phase of lithium hydrazinidoborane (LiN2H4BH3, LiHB), which is a new material for solid-state chemical hydrogen storage. We put in evidence that lithium hydrazinidoborane is a polymorphic material, with a stable low-temperature phase and a metastable high-temperature phase. The former is called β-LiHB and the latter α-LiHB. Results from DSC and XRD showed that the transition phase occurs at around 90 °C. On this basis, the crystal structure of the novel β-LiHB phase was solved. The potential of this material for solid-state chemical hydrogen storage was verified by TGA, DSC, and isothermal dehydrogenations. Upon the formation of the α-LiHB phase, the borane dehydrogenates. At 150 °C, it is able to generate 10 wt % of pure H 2 while a solid residue consisting of polymers with linear and cyclic units forms.

 Abstract:  Since the current transportation sector is the largest consumer of oil, and subsequently responsible for major air pollutants, it is inevitable to use alternative renewable sources of energies for vehicular applications. The hydrogen energy seems to be a promising candidate. To explore the possibility of achieving a solid-state high-capacity storage of hydrogen for onboard applications, we have performed first-principles density functional theoretical calculations of hydrogen storage properties of beryllium oxide clusters (BeO)n (n = 2-8). We observed that a polar BeO bond is responsible for H2 adsorption. The problem of cohesion of beryllium atoms does not arise, as they are an integral part of BeO clusters. The (BeO)n (n = 2-8) adsorbs 8-12 H2 molecules with an adsorption energy in the desirable range of reversible hydrogen storage. The gravimetric density of H2 adsorbed on BeO clusters meets the ultimate 7.5 wt % limit, recommended for onboard practical applications. In conclusion, beryllium oxide clusters exhibit a remarkable solid-state hydrogen storage. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Three-dimensionally nanoporous cellulose gels (NCG) were prepared by dissolution and coagulation of cellulose from aqueous alkali hydroxide-urea solution, and used to fabricate NCG/poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) nanocomposites by in situ ring-opening polymerization of ε-CL monomer in the NCG. The NCG content of the NCG/PCL nanocomposite could be controlled between 7 and 38% v/v by changing water content of starting hydrogel by compression dewatering. FT-IR and solid-state 13C NMR showed that the grafting of PCL onto cellulose are most likely occurred at the C6-OH groups and the grafting percentage of PCL is 25 wt % for the nanocomposite with 7% v/v NCG. 1H NMR, XRD, and DSC results indicate that the number-average molecular weight and crystal formation of PCL in the nanocomposites are remarkably restricted by the presence of NCG. AFM images confirm that the interconnected nanofibrillar cellulose network structure of NCG are finely distributed and preserved well in the PCL matrix after polymerization. DMA results show remarkable increase in tensile storage modulus of the nanocomposites above glass transition and melting temperatures of the PCL matrix. The percolation model was used to evaluate the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites, in which stress transfer among the interconnected nanofibrillar network is facilitated through strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and entanglement of cellulose nanofibers. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  MgH2 is a promising material for reversible solid-state hydrogen storage. It is known that particle size can have a strong impact on hydrogen dynamics and sorption characteristics, but more detailed insight has been hampered by the great challenge to prepare small and well-defined particles and study their hydrogen storage properties upon cycling. The preparation of MgH2 nanoparticles supported on high surface area carbon aerogels with pore sizes varying from 6-20 nm is reported. Two distinctly different MgH2 particle populations are observed: X-ray diffraction invisible nanoparticles with sizes below 20 nm, and larger, crystalline, MgH2 particles. They release hydrogen at temperatures 140 °C lower than bulk MgH2. The size-dependent hydrogen kinetics is for the first time corroborated by intrinsic hydrogen dynamics data obtained by solid state 1H NMR. Fast cycling is possible (80% of the capacity absorbed within 15 min at 18 bar and 300 °C), without a change in the hydrogen sorption properties, showing that the growth of the nanoparticles is effectively prevented by the carbon support. A clear correlation is found between the hydrogen desorption temperature and the size of the MgH2 nanoparticles. This illustrates the potential of the use of supported nanoparticles for fast, reversible, and stable hydrogen cycling. Supported MgH2 nanoparticles on carbon with different sizes are synthesized and show faster hydrogen mobility and sorption kinetics. Nanoparticles with sizes below 20 nm have a significant lower hydrogen release temperature and the mobility is three orders of magnitude faster compared to micrometer sized MgH2. The smaller the MgH2 particles, the lower the hydrogen release temperatures become. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

 Abstract:  Considerable efforts have been devoted to the catalytic modification of hydrogen storage materials. The K-modified Mg(NH2)2/2 LiH composite is a typical model for such studies. In this work, we analyze the origin of the kinetic barrier in the first step of the dehydrogenation and investigate how K catalyzes this heterogeneous solid-state reaction. Our results indicate that the interface reaction of Mg(NH2)2 and LiH is the main source of the kinetic barrier at the early stage of the dehydrogenation for the intensively ball-milled Mg(NH2)2/2 LiH sample. K can effectively activate Mg(NH2)2 as well as promote LiH to participate in the dehydrogenation. Three K species of KH, K2Mg(NH2)4, and Li3K(NH 2)4 likely transform circularly in the dehydrogenation (KH↔K2Mg(NH2)4↔KLi 3(NH2)4), which creates a more energy-favorable pathway and thus leads to the overall kinetic enhancement. This catalytic role of K in the amide/hydride system is different from the conventional catalysis of transition metals in the alanate system. Potassium is in the loop: The introduction of potassium to the Mg(NH2)2/2 LiH composite evolves intermediates of K2Mg(NH2)4, Li 3K(NH2)4, and KH, which circularly transform between each other to create a more energy-favorable pathway for dehydrogenation, and thus contributes to the overall kinetic enhancement.

 Abstract:  Nanostructured materials based on light elements such as Li, Mg, and Na are essential for energy storage and conversion applications, but often difficult to prepare with control over size and structure. We report a new strategy that is illustrated for the formation of magnesium boron hydrides, relevant compounds for instance for reversible solid state hydrogen storage. We started with small (5-10 nm) MgH2 nanoparticles inside the ∼10 nm pores of a carbon scaffold, and larger MgH2 crystallites on the exterior surface of the scaffold. The large difference in reactivity between the two types of MgH2 is used to selective react the small MgH2 particles inside the pores with B2H6 to form magnesium boron hydrides under mild conditions. In this way pore-confined magnesium boron hydrides are formed with MgB12H12 as the major phase. Hydrogen release from the confined magnesium boron hydrides starts just above the synthesis temperature of 120 °C. The addition of Ni brings about the reaction to proceed readily at temperatures as low as 30 °C. Furthermore, by Ni addition and tuning the synthesis temperature, the product distribution can be steered toward Mg(BH4)2 and other magnesium boron hydrides. This shows the suitability of our method to selectively form pore-confined complex metal hydrides, such as MgB12H12 for which no synthesis strategy had been reported until now. This strategy might also be relevant for other novel energy storage and conversion materials, which are difficult to nanostructure in a controlled manner by conventional methods. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

Furthermore, these materials show moderate sorption capabilities for hydrogen (up to 1.07 wt%, 77 K and 1.0 bar) and carbon dioxide (up to 12.7 wt%, 273 K and 1.0 bar).

 Abstract:  Hydrogen storage properties of the (nLiAlH4 + LiNH2) hydride composite where n = 1, 3, 11.5 and 30, synthesized by high energy ball milling have been investigated. The composite with the molar ratio n = 1 releases large quantities of H2 (up to ~5 wt.%) during ball milling up to 100-150 min. The quantity of released H2 rapidly decreases for the molar ratio n = 3 and is not observed for n = 11.5 and 30. The XRD studies indicate that the H2 release is a result of a solid state decomposition of LiAlH4 into (1/3)Li3AlH6 + (2/3)Al + H2 and subsequently decomposition of (1/3)Li3AlH6 into LiH + (1/3)Al + 0.5H2. Apparently, LiAlH4 is profoundly destabilized during ball milling by the presence of a large quantity of LiNH2 (37.7 wt.%) in the n = 1 composite. The rate of dehydrogenation at 100-170 °C (at 1 bar H2) is adversely affected by insufficient microstructural refinement, as observed for the n = 1 composite, which was milled for only 2 min to avoid H2 discharge during milling. XRD studies show that isothermal dehydrogenation of (nLiAlH4 + LiNH2) occurs by the same LiAlH4 decomposition reactions as those found during ball milling. The ball milled n = 1 composite stored under Ar at 80 °C slowly discharges large quantities of H2 approaching 3.5 wt.% after 8 days of storage. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

 Abstract:  A quantitative understanding of nanocrystal phase transformations would enable more efficient energy conversion and catalysis, but has been hindered by difficulties in directly monitoring well-characterized nanoscale systems in reactive environments. We present a new in situ luminescence-based probe enabling direct quantification of nanocrystal phase transformations, applied here to the hydriding transformation of palladium nanocrystals. Our approach reveals the intrinsic kinetics and thermodynamics of nanocrystal phase transformations, eliminating complications of substrate strain, ligand effects and external signal transducers. Clear size-dependent trends emerge in nanocrystals long accepted to be bulk-like in behaviour. Statistical mechanical simulations show these trends to be a consequence of nanoconfinement of a thermally driven, first-order phase transition: near the phase boundary, critical nuclei of the new phase are comparable in size to the nanocrystal itself. Transformation rates are then unavoidably governed by nanocrystal dimensions. Our results provide a general framework for understanding how nanoconfinement fundamentally impacts broad classes of thermally driven solid-state phase transformations relevant to hydrogen storage, catalysis, batteries and fuel cells. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

 Abstract:  Magnesium acetate was micronized by the supercritical antisolvent (SAS) process.

 Abstract:  On-board hydrogen storage is a critical issue to realize the so-called hydrogen economy that is potential to solve the challenges of energy and environment. Hydrogen stored in solid state materials is a promising method to be able to achieve the on-board applications due to its advantages of high density and safety issues. However, the challenges of high temperature and slow kinetics of hydrogen release must be addressed. Fundamentally, the temperature of hydrogen release is directly dependent on the enthalpy of the reaction. It is demonstrated that the previous approaches such as ball milling with catalysts can significantly enhance the hydrogen release rate but influence very little the thermodynamics (the enthalpy). In this talk, we report some recent research results on hydrogen storage materials (magnesium, complex hydrides and ammonia borane) confined in porous templates. It is confirmed that the hydrogen desorption temperature can be significantly decreased, which means the thermodynamics of hydrogen release reactions can be altered through nanoconfinement. © OSA 2013.

 Abstract:  Novel borohydrides of para- and meta-bis-(ammonium)-benzene (m/p-BABB), possessing theoretical hydrogen storage capacities of 10.1 wt%, have been synthesized upon metathesis of p/m-benzenediamine dihydrochloride (p/m-BDADC) and lithium borohydride through simple ball-milling. It was found that the dehydrogenation of the BABBs proceeds in the temperature range of 50-200 °C via a multistep mechanism similar to that of NH3BH3 and [NH4]+[BH4]-, releasing 8.35 and 6.52 wt% hydrogen from p- and m-BABB, respectively.

 Abstract:  In this work, porous Co3O4 materials were prepared via a solid-state conversion process of a freshly prepared cobalt-based metal-organic framework (Co-MOF) crystal. Herein, the unique Co-MOF crystal was formed via the specific chemical coordination between the carboxylic ligand azobenzene-3,5,4′-tricarboxylic acid (H3ABTC) and the auxiliary ligand 4,4′-bipyridine (bpy) to construct 2-dimensional (2D) bilayer structural intermediates, which subsequently formed a 3D polycatenation supramolecular array architecture with the assistance of π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions. Subsequently, porous Co3O4 particles were obtained by simple thermolysis of the Co-MOF crystals via a two-step calcination treatment. The results demonstrated that the as-made Co3O4 displays crystalline and well-defined porous features and can be applied as a supercapacitor electrode, and its energy storage performances were investigated in 2 M KOH electrolyte. The electrochemical results showed that the porous Co3O4 particles exhibit a high specific capacitance of 150 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 and retain slightly enhanced capacitance after 3400 cycles, which could be ascribed to its higher specific surface area and accessible channel structural features.

 Abstract:  Magnesium borohydride (Mg(BH4)2) has been infiltrated into highly ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK3) containing dispersed Ni nanoparticles (Ni NPs) to investigate the possible synergetic effects of nanoconfinement and catalysis by Ni NPs. Ni NPs (5 wt%) were introduced into the CMK3 nanoscaffold (CMK3-Ni) then Mg(BH4)2 was slowly infiltrated into this prepared CMK3-Ni template to synthesize a CMK3-Ni confined (Mg(BH4)2) system (denoted as CMK3-Ni-Mg(BH 4)2). Solid-state 11B NMR and FT-IR spectra confirmed that Mg(BH4)2 was in the pores of CMK3-Ni. Temperature-programmed desorption-mass spectroscopy (TPD-MS) and pressure-composition-temperature (PCT) measurements were utilized to study the hydrogen desorption properties for this nanoconfined CMK3-Ni-Mg(BH 4)2 system, which was demonstrated to be remarkably improved, e.g. the hydrogen desorption temperature was dramatically decreased and the release rate was significantly enhanced. The hydrogen started to be released from the CMK3-Ni-Mg(BH4)2 at a temperature of only 75 °C (measured by TPD) and reached its peak release rate at a temperature of 155 °C, compared with 270 °C and above 350 °C respectively from pure Mg(BH4)2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time Mg(BH4)2 decomposition has been realized at a temperature below 100 °C, which is of great significance for the use of this material for practical hydrogen storage for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  One-dimensional nanostructured polyaniline (1D nano-PANI), including nanofibers, nanowires, nanobelts, nanotubes, nanorods, nanoneedles, and nanosticks, has been extensively studied recently due to its unique properties and many potential applications. As a continuation of our previous review on 1D nano-PANI (D. H. Zhang and Y. Y.

 Abstract:  A novel polymorph of N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) is discovered three decades after the first report on the X-ray crystal structure of this bioactive compound. The crystal structure of the new orthorhombic polymorph (form II in the P212121 space group) is characterized by X-ray diffraction and compared to the triclinic structure of form I (NALCYS02 and NALCYS10 in the P1 space group). Both polymorphs contain a C(7) chain of COOH⋯OC-CH3 hydrogen bonds, except that the COOH group is rotated by 180° in form II to make an auxiliary C-H⋯O interaction with the methyl group in a R22(8) ring motif. The known form I contains weak S-H⋯OC-OH and N-H⋯S hydrogen bonds whereas the new form II has only N-H⋯S interactions. The conformational polymorphs of NAC were compared by Hirshfeld surface analysis (dnorm) and XPac methods, and were spectroscopically characterized by FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy. The bulk phases were distinguished by their 13C ss-NMR and powder X-ray diffraction line patterns. The two polymorphs are enantiotropically related (form I has a higher melting temperature and lower enthalpy of fusion). However, no phase transition was observed in the DSC analysis. The metastable form II converted to stable form I in solid-state grinding, a slurry medium and storage in ambient conditions for 3 months. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  The renewable resources related, for instance, to solar energies exhibit two main characteristics. They have no practical limits in regards to the efficiency and their various capture methods. However, their intermittence prevents any direct and immediate use of the resulting power. McPhy-Energy proposes solutions based on water electrolysis for hydrogen generation and storage on reversible metal hydrides to efficiently cover various energy generation ranges from MW h to GW h. Large stationary storage units, based on MgH2, are presently developed, including both the advanced materials and systems for a total energy storage from ∼70 to more than 90% efficient. Various designs of MgH2-based tanks are proposed, allowing the optional storage of the heat of the Mg-MgH2 reaction in an adjacent phase changing material. The combination of these operations leads to the storage of huge amounts of hydrogen and heat in our so-called adiabatic-tanks. Adapted to intermittent energy production and consumption from renewable sources (wind, sun, tide, etc.), nuclear over-production at night, or others, tanks distribute energy on demand for local applications (on-site domestic needs, refueling stations, etc.) via turbine or fuel cell electricity production. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Thermal decomposition of NaBH4-2NH3BH3 and KBH4-2NH3BH3 prepared by ball milling are studied using in situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction and simultaneous thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and mass spectroscopy. The starting materials NaBH4 or KBH4 and NH3BH3 do not react during ball milling or thermal treatment. Initially, ammonia borane decomposes independently of the presence of NaBH4 or KBH4, as revealed by solid-state 11B magic-angle spinning NMR, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction. Samples of NaBH4-2NH3BH3 and KBH4-2NH3BH3 were heated to 215 C and subsequently investigated ex situ at RT. These samples consist of the respective metal borohydride and the decomposition product polyiminoborane. A significant loss of borane and borazine gasses from the samples is observed during decomposition. Therefore, the present samples do not store hydrogen reversibly at the conditions used in this study.

"Seperate the questions with commasTitle:Reversible hydrogen storage by NaAlH4 confined within a titanium-functionalized MOF-74(Mg) nanoreactor
 Abstract:  We demonstrate that NaAlH4 confined within the nanopores of a titanium-functionalized metal-organic framework (MOF) template MOF-74(Mg) can reversibly store hydrogen with minimal loss of capacity. Hydride-infiltrated samples were synthesized by melt infiltration, achieving loadings up to 21 wt %. MOF-74(Mg) possesses one-dimensional, 12 Å channels lined with Mg atoms having open coordination sites, which can serve as sites for Ti catalyst stabilization. MOF-74(Mg) is stable under repeated hydrogen desorption and hydride regeneration cycles, allowing it to serve as a ""nanoreactor"". Confining NaAlH4 within these pores alters the decomposition pathway by eliminating the stable intermediate Na3AlH6 phase observed during bulk decomposition and proceeding directly to NaH, Al, and H2, in agreement with theory. The onset of hydrogen desorption for both Ti-doped and undoped nano-NaAlH4@MOF-74(Mg) is ∼50 °C, nearly 100 °C lower than bulk NaAlH4. However, the presence of titanium is not necessary for this increase in desorption kinetics but enables rehydriding to be almost fully reversible. Isothermal kinetic studies indicate that the activation energy for H2 desorption is reduced from 79.5 kJ mol-1 in bulk Ti-doped NaAlH4 to 57.4 kJ mol-1 for nanoconfined NaAlH4. The structural properties of nano-NaAlH 4@MOF-74(Mg) were probed using 23Na and 27Al solid-state MAS NMR, which indicates that the hydride is not decomposed during infiltration and that Al is present as tetrahedral AlH4 ® anions prior to desorption and as Al metal after desorption. Because of the highly ordered MOF structure and monodisperse pore dimensions, our results allow key template features to be identified to ensure reversible, low-temperature hydrogen storage. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  The development of highly efficient hydrogen storage materials is one of the main challenges that must be tackled in a widely expected hydrogen economy. Physisorption in porous materials with high surface areas and chemisorption in hydrides are the two main options for solid state hydrogen storage, and both options possess their inherent advantages and drawbacks.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen is an essential component in many industrial processes. As a result of the recent increase in the development of shale gas, steam reforming of shale gas has received considerable attention as a major source of H 2, and the more efficient use of hydrogen is strongly demanded. Palladium is well known as a hydrogen-storage metal and an effective catalyst for reactions related to hydrogen in a variety of industrial processes. Here, we present remarkably enhanced capacity and speed of hydrogen storage in Pd nanocrystals covered with the metal-organic framework (MOF) HKUST-1 (copper(II) 1,3,5- benzenetricarboxylate). The Pd nanocrystals covered with the MOF have twice the storage capacity of the bare Pd nanocrystals. The significantly enhanced hydrogen storage capacity was confirmed by hydrogen pressure-composition isotherms and solid-state deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance measurements.

 Abstract:  Radioactive liquid waste has been stored in underground carbon steel tanks for nearly 60 years at the Savannah River Site (SRS). The site is currently in the process of removing the waste from these tanks in order to place it into vitrified, stable state for longer term storage. The last stage in the removal sequence is a chemical cleaning step that breaks up and dissolves metal oxide solids that cannot be easily pumped out of the tank. Oxalic acid (OA) will be used to chemically clean the tanks after waste retrieval is completed. The waste tanks at SRS were constructed from carbon steel materials and thus are vulnerable to corrosion in acidic media. In addition to structural impacts, the impact of corrosion on the hydrogen generated during the process must be assessed. Electrochemical and coupon immersion tests were used to investigate the corrosion mechanism at anticipated process conditions. The tests were conducted at OA concentrations between 2.5 and 8 wt.% and at temperatures between 60 and 75 °C. In general, the corrosion rates increased with temperature and oxalic acid concentration. The testing also showed that the corrosion rates were dependent upon the reduction of the iron species that had dissolved in solution. Initial corrosion rates in 8 wt.% OA at 75 °C were approximately 140 mpy (3.6 mm/yr) due to the reduction of the ferric species to ferrous species. After 4 weeks, as the ferric species depleted, the corrosion rate at this condition decreased to approximately 30 mpy (0.75 mm/yr). On the other hand, as the electrochemical tests demonstrated, the hydrogen evolution reaction became more dominant at these later times. © 2013 by NACE International.

 Abstract:  Silver-palladium alloys have various industrial applications, such as in hydrogen permeation and hydrogen storage materials. The objective of the present study is to determine experimentally the thermodynamic properties of solid state silver-palladium alloys in low temperatures. Thermodynamic measurements of silver-palladium alloys have been performed over a temperature range of 450-750 K by the electromotive force method with superionic conductor AgI as the solid electrolyte. The activity and partial molar Gibbs energy of silver were obtained for Ag-Pd alloys over the whole composition range, and the thermodynamic properties of palladium were calculated using the Gibbs-Duhem equation. The results show that activities of silver exhibit fairly large negative deviations over most of the composition range, and the activities of palladium are characterized by both negative and positive deviations from the ideal Raoultian behavior. The results also show the minimum integral enthalpy of mixing of Ag-Pd alloys to locate at around 60 at.% Ag. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

 Abstract:  NiCl2 and CoCl2 were adopted to enhance the dehydrogenation of hydrazine bisborane (HBB), respectively, of which NiCl 2 showed better performance. By adding 2.0 mol. % NiCl2, the dehydrogenation property of HBB was significantly improved, for example, the impurity of NH3 during the dehydrogenation of HBB was totally suppressed with more than 13.0 wt. % of pure hydrogen evolved. By Kissinger method, the apparent activation energies of the first step for HBB and Ni-doped HBB were calculated to be 143.2 and 60.7 kJ mol-1, respectively. DSC result showed that the addition of NiCl2 did not change the enthalpy change of HBB dehydrogenation. Based on theoretical analysis and literature review, the improved dehydrogenation property of HBB was potentially ascribed to the solid state interaction of Ni2+ with the electronegative N in the NH2 group of HBB. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  With a mandate to reach 20/20/20 targets, new strategies are now focusing on the increased use of electricity to power transportation. Particularly in major urban areas of the EU, capillary use of electric vehicles are being encouraged, however, as these vehicles will be powered by the grid, there is always the risk that load peaks will occur. This work is just one of several being developed as part of the 23.9 MLN Euros INGRID European project started in July 2012, which combines solid-state high-density hydrogen storage systems with advanced ICT technologies for distribution grids. One possible solution which has been designed, is an off-grid utility to store renewable electricity captured from wind/solar sources and a re-charging point for full battery electric cars.

 Abstract:  Mixtures of sodium alanate (NaAlH 4) with the nanometric Ni (n-Ni) additive were processed by controlled ball milling for 15 min in a magneto-mill and subsequently investigated by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and volumetric hydrogen desorption in a Sieverts-type apparatus. The apparent activation energy of the decomposition of Na 3AlH 6, which is the decomposition product in the first dehydrogenation step of NaAlH 4, is equal to ~140 kJ/mol and ~101 kJ/mol for ball milled NaAlH 4 and NaAlH 4 +5 wt% n-Ni, respectively, as determined by the Kissinger method in DSC tests. The apparent activation energy for the decomposition of NaH, which is the decomposition product in the second dehydrogenation step of Na 3AlH 6, is estimated as equal to ~143 kJ/mol and ~226 kJ/mol for ball milled NaAlH 4 and NaAlH 4+5 wt% n-Ni, respectively. It seems that the n-Ni additive accelerates the decomposition of Na 3AlH 6 but decelerates the decomposition of NaH. Volumetric desorption tests indicate a substantial enhancement of the rate of hydrogen desorption at 170 °C for the ball milled NaAlH 4+5 wt% n-Ni nanocomposite as a result of the catalytic action of n-Ni. No reaction of n-Ni with the NaAlH 4 matrix is observed during dehydrogenation at 170-280 °C. The n-Ni catalyst used in the present work compares very favorably with other catalytic additives reported in the literature (e.g., metal chlorides) which were used for the enhancement of dehydrogenation of NaAlH 4.

 Abstract:  An attempt has been made to predict phase formation using a CALPHAD-based approach for a large number of compositions that are known to form FCC, BCC and a mixture of FCC and BCC phases. The stable phase is assumed to be the first phase that is formed upon cooling from liquid state with the highest driving force. The driving force for other phases at the transition for various compositions is also presented. A comparison between the parametric approach of phase prediction by study of thermodynamic and topological parameters on one hand and the CALPHAD approach on the other is also presented. CALPHAD approach appears to predict BCC phase formation much more accurately than the FCC phase formation. The results indicate that solid solution formation in multicomponent alloys is favored when the ratio of ΔS config/ΔS fusion is greater than 1 and 1.2 for equiatomic and non-equiatomic alloys, respectively. The results also point out that BCC phase is favored when the atomic size difference is larger, which is reflected by a higher value of ΔS σ/k. Formation of FCC phase appears to be governed mainly by ΔH mix, while BCC phase governed by ΔS σ/k, which is representative of strain in the structure. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Seperate the questions with commasTitle:Enhanced hydrogen desorption of an ammonia borane and lithium hydride system through synthesised intermediate compounds
 Abstract:  A new hydrogen ""storage"" strategy is demonstrated for an ammonia borane (AB) and LiH system by means of moderate mechanical milling of the two species under an inert atmosphere. This not only avoids reactive hydrogen release during milling but also leads to formation of an intermediate composite LixNH3-xBH3 (x < 1) to store hydrogen with good stability at ambient temperature. The presence of the intermediate composite and sufficient dispersion of the AB and LiH particles facilitate further reaction of AB and LiH with hydrogen release at a relatively low temperature. Herein, we report a composite system obtained by this simple but effective approach to destabilize AB for enhanced hydrogen release at a desirable temperature. A 10 min milled 3AB/5LiH can release hydrogen of ∼5.3 wt% at 70°C, and another ∼5.5 wt% at 92°C; so a total of ∼10.8 wt% hydrogen can be obtained before 92°C. With an increase of the LiH content, this temperature can be further reduced down to 61°C, which is a significant improvement that has not been reported before. Moreover, our results show a much lower dehydrogenation temperature, reduced from 92 to 67°C, and a fast kinetics, e.g., 5 and 9 wt% mass loss at 95 °C within 415 and 1050 s, respectively, which is 6 times faster than those reported in the literature (5 and 9 wt% of mass loss at 100 °C within 2400 and 6900 s, respectively). To the best of our knowledge, our system possesses the highest dehydrogenation capacity (5 wt%) at the low hydrogen release temperature (67 °C), with great improvement on the dehydrogenation kinetics in the solid-state hydride systems. A systemic investigation on the mechanism of the reaction under different milling conditions, reaction temperatures and LiH contents is reported here for the first time. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.

 Abstract:  One of the current main challenges in green-power storage and smart grids is the lack of effective solutions for accommodating the unbalance between renewable energy sources, that offer intermittent electricity supply, and a variable electricity demand. Energy management systems have to be foreseen for the near future, while they still represent a major challenge.

 Abstract:  The active monomer form of the male-produced pheromone of the Mediterranean fruit fly can be isolated selectively from its equilibrating trimer species by encapsulation within a calixarene pocket built into a hydrogen-bonded framework from guanidinium 4-sulfocalix[4]arene. Encapsulation of the Δ1- pyrroline guest significantly perturbs the assembly of the quasihexagonal two-dimensional guanidinium-sulfonate network of the guest-free framework, to the extent that guanidinium ions are excluded from some sites to accommodate the steric requirements of the guest. Nonetheless, single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals the preservation of a layered structrure in which the calixarene capsules stack in an antiparallel configuration. These observations illustrate that the binding of the pheromone monomer by the calixarene is sufficiently strong to overcome the loss of guanidinium-sulfonate hydrogen bonds, which is corroborated by the strong binding constants measured in solution. The solid-state encapsulation stabilizes the otherwise volatile unstable monomer form, suggesting an effective strategy for the storage, application, and controlled release of an important agricultural adjuvant. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  We report a systematic first principles density functional study on the electronic structure, elastic and optical properties of nitrogen based solid hydrogen storage materials LiNH2, NaNH2, KNH2, and RbNH2. The ground state structural properties are calculated by using standard density functional theory, and also dispersion corrected density functional theory. We find that vander Waals interactions are dominant in LiNH2 whereas they are relatively weak in other alkali metal amides. The calculated elastic constants show that all the compounds are mechanically stable and LiNH2 is found to be a stiffer material among the alkali metal amides. The melting temperatures are calculated and follow the order RbNH2 < KNH2 < NaNH2 < LiNH 2. Theelectronic band structure is calculated by using the Tran-Blaha modified Becke-Johnson potential and found that all the compounds are insulators, with a considerable band gap. The[NH2]- derived states completely dominate in the entire valence band region while the metal atom states occupy the conduction band. The calculated band structure is used to analyzethe different interband optical transitions occurring between valence and conduction bands.

 Abstract:  Solid-state molybdenum sulfide clusters with an octahedral metal framework, the superconducting Chevrel phases, are applied to catalysis. The cluster of copper salt, CuxMo6S8 (x = 2. 94), stored in air is treated in a hydrogen stream above 300 °C. The activated cluster exhibits catalytic activity for the ring-opening of tetrahydrofuran, yielding butyraldehyde. Cyclic ethers such as trimethylene oxide and tetrahydropyran are also converted to the corresponding aldehydes. The cluster contains nonstoichiometric defects of sulfur atoms. Oxygen atoms are incorporated at the sulfur-deficient sites upon storage in air, but they are removed from the sites by the activation in a hydrogen stream. The resulting coordinatively unsaturated molybdenum atoms are catalytically active for the ring-opening reaction. The molybdenum atom in an intermediate oxidation state around 2+ is moderately coordinated by the oxygen of tetrahydrofuran and favorably releases the produced aldehyde.

 Abstract:  In this study, we have developed and characterized various Mg-V-Ni compositions with respect to hydrogen storage. The study was conducted using magnesium as the base material with additions of 5 atomic% of nickel and vanadium in the range of 2.5-10 atomic%. The various compositions were synthesized using high-energy ball milling with different milling times. The compositions were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, and X-ray diffraction, and the hydriding-dehydriding characteristics studied using the Sievert method. It was found that the maximum reversible hydrogen storage capacity in the Mg-V-Ni system is 5.71 mass %. Furthermore, it was found that 6 mass% of hydrogen is absorbed within the first 5 min at 210°C. This lowered hydriding temperature is associated with the presence of vanadium as a catalyst. The hydriding enthalpy of the optimized (highest storage capacity) Mg-V-Ni composition has been measured using differential scanning calorimetry as 79.15±3.56 kJ/mol of H2 and the hydriding entropy was obtained as 141.18 ± 6.35 J/mol of H2 K. © 2012 by Begell House, Inc.

 Abstract:  Understanding the nature and formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed in electrochemical storage devices, such as Li-ion batteries, is most important for improving functionality. Few experiments exist that adequately probe the SEI, particularly in situ. We perform predictive ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of the anode-electrolyte interface for several electrolytes and interface functionalizations. These show strongly differing effects on the reducibility of the electrolyte. Electrolyte reduction occurs rapidly, on a picosecond time scale. Orientational ordering of electrolyte near the interface precedes reduction. The reduced species depend strongly on surface functionalization and presence of LiPF6 salt. While LiPF6 salt in ethylene carbonate is more stable at a hydrogen-terminated anode, oxygen/hydroxyl termination causes spontaneous dissociation to form LiF and other fluorophosphates. LiF migrates to the interface creating chainlike structures, consistent with experimental observations of LiF agglomeration. Inorganic products such as LiF and Li2CO3 migrate closer to the anode than purely organic components, consistent with their more ionic character. Significantly, we conclude that while the electrolyte reduction occurs at the molecular level near the interface, requiring specific alignments and proximity, the reducibility is governed by the average reduction potential barrier between the electrode (anode) and the electrolyte. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Metal-incorporated, graphitic microporous carbon, containing highly ordered graphene layers, has been converted from highly thin amorphous carbon film by a metal nanoparticle sputtering process at ambient substrate temperature. A standard direct-current magnetron sputtering system is used in this purpose. The process consists of a dual effect of activation and graphitization of amorphous carbon to graphitic microporous carbon. The sputtering plasma, containing energetic ions and sub-atomic particles, act as dry-etchant to activate the a:C film to transform it into microporous carbon. Whereas, the inelastic 'knock-on' collision between metal nanoparticles/ions and the nuclei of C atoms manifests the atom displacement and re-arrangement into ordered structure to form graphitic domains within the microporous carbon network. The average number of graphene layer formation has been controlled by adjusting the sputtering voltage and current, as the carbon atom displacement rate is dependent on the irradiation current density. Raman spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirms the high controllability of the number of graphene layer formation as a function of sputtering parameters. The method is simple, cost-effective and compatible with modern solid-state device fabrication processing, as it comprises vacuum-based physical vapor deposition techniques, and also, can be adopted easily for transitional metal incorporation into graphene and other carbon nanostructures for potential hydrogen storage and related clean energy applications. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  A composite mixture of NaBH4 and Mg2NiH4 (4:5, M/M) was prepared by high-energy ball milling and was investigated for solid-state storage of hydrogen. Addition of Mg2NiH4 to NaBH4 leads to formation of the stable ternary boride phase MgNi 2.5B2 and lowers the enthalpy of hydrogen desorption for NaBH4 from 110 to 76 ± 5 kJ mol-1H2. As a consequence of this addition, the onset temperature of hydrogen desorption decreases from about 500 °C in NaBH4 to 360 °C in the NaBH4/Mg2NiH4 composite mixture. Furthermore, the system shows reversibility and is able to store 2.5 wt % hydrogen for a number of cycles.

 Abstract:  During the polymorph screening of an active pharmaceutical ingredient tilorone dihydrochloride (chemical name 2,7-bis[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]-9- fluorenone dihydrochloride) two new polymorphic modifications - III and IV - were obtained. The crystal structures of both polymorphs were established from X-ray powder diffraction. An interesting phenomenon has been observed at ambient conditions for III, which transforms into a novel hydrated form IIIh during 2-3 h when the humidity in the storage room increases to 70% or more. As soon as the relative humidity falls to 30% or less, IIIh transforms into the parent anhydrous form III within an hour. Form IIIh has been identified as a trihydrate of tilorone dihydrochloride, and its crystal structure has been established from X-ray powder diffraction. On the basis of the crystal structures and hydrogen-bonding patterns, a mechanistic model of reversible hydration/dehydration solid-state transformation III ↔ IIIh depending on the relative humidity is proposed. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Nanostructured, porous metals are of great interest for material scientists since they combine high surface area, gas permeability, electrical conductivity, plasmonic behavior, and size-enhanced catalytic reactivity. Here we present the formation of multimetallic porous three-dimensional networks by a template-free self-assembly process. Nanochains are formed by the controlled coalescence of Au, Ag, Pt, and Pd nanoparticles in aqueous media, and their interconnection and interpenetration leads to the formation of a self-supporting network. The resulting noble-metal-gels are transformed into solid aerogels by the supercritical drying technique. Compared to previously reported results, the technique is facilitated by exclusion of additional destabilizers. Moreover, temperature control is demonstrated as a powerful tool, allowing acceleration of the gelation process as well as improvement of its reproducibility and applicability. Electron microscopy shows the nanostructuring of the network and its high porosity. XRD and EDX STEM are used to investigate the alloying behavior of the bimetallic aerogels and prove the control of the alloying state by temperature induced phase modifications. Furthermore, the resulting multimetallic aerogels show an extremely low relative density (<0.2%) and a very high surface area (>50 m2/g) compared to porous noble metals obtained by other approaches. Electrically conductive thin films as well as hybrid materials with organic polymers are depicted to underline the processability of the materials, which is a key factor regarding handling of the fragile structures and integration into device architectures. Owing to their exceptional and tunable properties, multimetallic aerogels are very promising materials for applications in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis, hydrogen storage, and sensor systems but also in surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and the preparation of transparent conductive substrates. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Safe storage of hydrogen is a key issue for development of the hydrogen economy. Solid-state hydrogen storage through reversible formation of hydrides is one of the most promising methods. Herein reports for the very first time a combined experimental and theoretical study of the hydrogen absorption- desorption of MSi Zintl phases (M = K, Rb, and Cs). Upon direct hydrogenation of the MSi phases at 100 °C, the α-MSiH3 silanides (4.3, 2.6, and 1.85 wt % H2 for M = K, Rb, and Cs, respectively) are formed and the corresponding alloys are reobtained upon desorption. Besides the full resolution of the crystal structures of the α-MSiH3 silanides and their low-temperature β-phases, by neutron powder diffraction, we show an enthalpy-entropy compensation effect for the MSi/α-MSiH3 equilibrium: a simultaneous linear increase in the enthalpy (more stable silanide) and entropy change (more localized H atoms in the crystal structure) for the larger cation (Cs+). Through this phenomenon, a desorption temperature of ca. 410 K is obtained at 0.1 MPa hydrogen equilibrium pressure for all three systems. Indeed, this study shows for the first time that the alkali silanides form a new family of complex hydrides that can be considered as promising materials for reversible hydrogen storage near ambient conditions in the solid state. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  The Ca(BH4)2-MgH2 composite system represents a promising candidate for mobile hydrogen storage due to a 10.5 wt % theoretical hydrogen storage capacity and an estimated equilibrium temperature lower than 160 °C. For this system, the reversibility was achieved without further addition of additives.

This study shows that the intermediate formation of Ca4Mg3H14 upon dehydrogenation of the Ca(BH4)2-MgH2 composite system is not a necessary step, and its presence can be adjusted modifying the preparation procedure. Moreover, the d-value mismatch calculated for the {111}CaB6/{1011}Mg plane pair is the lowest among the other plane pairs considered in the system.

 Abstract:  Temperature is shown to have a huge influence on the electronic properties of nanometric spinel-type cobalt oxides precipitated at low temperature in alkaline media. The initial phase, with formula HxLi yCo3-δO4, contains hydrogen, lithium, cobalt vacancies, and a mixed valence Co4+/Co3+ within the structure, leading to an electronic conductivity higher than that of stoichiometric Co3O4. Its structural evolution under thermal treatment was studied by X-ray diffraction and chemical analysis, which reveal modifications in structure and compositions, involving water release, increase of the Co/O atomic ratio, and modification of the Co 4+/Co3+ ratio. The RT to 300 C range is particularly interesting as a single-phase domain and the materials obtained in this temperature range were investigated by chemical analysis, electronic conductivity and specific surface area measurements. Upon increasing temperature, the enhancement of the Co4+/Co3+ ratio, together with cationic redistribution in the spinel framework, results in an improvement of the electronic conductivity (more than 2 orders of magnitude for materials heated above 150 C). Finally, the systematic thermal study of electronic conductivity and specific surface area of the materials allows to determine an optimal heat-treatment temperature leading to an optimized active electrode material for electrochemical energy storage applications, especially in supercapacitors.

It is hypothesized that the added metal cations may activate the borohydride ion to such an extent that its H δ- can easily react with the Hδ+ of the [Al(NH3)6]3+ cation, resulting in an enhanced interaction between the Hδ+ and Hδ-, thus enhancing their dehydrogenation kinetics. Subsequent deuterium isotope and X-ray measurements support the hypothesis that the Hδ+â|̄ -δH interactions play a role in the dehydrogenation of the metal borohydride ammoniates. Of the systems investigated, 0.5Mg(BH 4)2/Li2Al(BH4)5· 6NH3 is notable as it releases more than 10 wt.% high-purity H 2 within 30 min below 120 C. This ranks among the highest values currently reported for potential solid-state hydrogen storage materials.

 Abstract:  Radioactive liquid waste has been stored in underground carbon steel tanks for nearly 60 years at the Savannah River Site. The site is currently in the process of removing the waste from these tanks in order to place it into vitrified, stable state for longer term storage. The last stage in the removal sequence is a chemical cleaning step that breaks up and dissolves metal oxide solids that cannot be easily pumped out of the tank. Oxalic acid has been selected for this purpose because it is an effective chelating agent for the solids and is not as corrosive as other acids. Electrochemical and immersion studies were conducted to investigate the corrosion behavior of carbon steel in simulated chemical cleaning environments. The effects of temperature, agitation, and the presence of sludge solids in the oxalic acid on the corrosion rate and the likelihood of hydrogen evolution were determined. The testing showed that the corrosion rates decreased significantly in the presence of the sludge solids. Corrosion rates increased with agitation, however, the changes were less noticeable. ©2012 by NACE International.

 Abstract:  The lack of an efficient hydrogen storage material has so far hindered the implementation of hydrogen as an energy vector, that is, a substance that allows the transfer through space and time of a certain quantity of energy from its original source. This work presents porous Ti(III) hydride gels as a promising new hydrogen storage material, exploiting the first example of a solid-state homoleptic metal hydride that binds further H2 ligands using the Kubas interaction. These materials use bridging hydride ligands as an ultralightweight structural feature to support a microporous network of Ti binding sites for molecular H2 chemisorption. High-pressure Raman spectroscopy confirmed the first evidence of TiH5 and TiH7 species, in some ways analogous to hypervalent MH5 and MH 7 (M = Si, Ge, Sn) species. The material with the highest capacity has an excess reversible storage of 3.49 wt % at 140 bar and 298 K without saturation, corresponding to a volumetric density of 44.3 kg/m3, comparable to the DOE 2017 volumetric system goal of 40 kgH2/m 3.

 Abstract:  Although thermodynamically unfavorable, magnesium nitride hydrogenation was realized by high-energy ball milling via the formation of hydride and amide or imide. Using a vibratory mill at room temperature, with initial H2 pressures of 40-80 bar, a constant-rate pressure decrease was observed throughout 200 h experiments, reflecting hydrogenation reaction progress. A combination of 1H and 15N solid-state magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR techniques was used to identify unambiguously the reaction products as the metastable solid mixture of magnesium hydride and magnesium amide/imide. The NMR shows that the reaction products are disordered and of nonbulk, noncrystalline character. Our thermodynamic analysis shows that considerable pressure elevation and mechanical surface destabilization favor the hydrogenation reaction. We present an original model which suggests for the first time that the local gas pressure rises considerably in a confined zone of the fine powder impacted by colliding balls in the mill. This model describes a flow-restricted, short-term, nearly isothermal pressure elevation. The demonstrated ability to facilitate such thermodynamic unfavorable reactions and create a metastable hydrogen-rich product suggests a new concept for hydrogen storage and chemical conversion processes. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Using 90Sr as a representative isotope, we present a framework for understanding beta decay within the solid state. We quantify three key physical and chemical principles, namely momentum-induced recoil during the decay event, defect creation due to physical displacement, and chemical evolution over time. A fourth effect, that of electronic excitation, is also discussed, but this is difficult to quantify and is strongly material dependent. The analysis is presented for the specific cases of SrTiO3 and SrH2. By comparing the recoil energy with available threshold displacement data we show that in many beta-decay situations defects such as Frenkel pairs will not be created during decay as the energy transfer is too low. This observation leads to the concept of chemical evolution over time, which we quantify using density functional theory. Using a combination of Bader analysis, phonon calculations and cohesive energy calculations, we show that beta decay leads to counter-intuitive behavior that has implications for nuclear waste storage and novel materials design. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

 Abstract:  Latent heat of phase change materials (PCMs) has long been regarded as constant. In this work, it is found that this parameter can be altered when they are in nanoscale. We designed and assembled a nanocapsule-confinement system with stearic acid (SA) sealed in silica nanoshells to investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics of their phase transition in nanoscale. It is interesting that heat storage capacity of the obtained SA@SiO2 nanocapsules (NCs) could be increased up to 374.2 kJ/kg, about 36.9% more than that of the unconfined SA (273.3 kJ/kg). This is because the high superimposed stress from the curvature effect inside SiO2 nanoshells would significantly shorten the intermolecular spacing of SA as compared to their unconfined state, which will especially strengthen hydrogen bonds of SA, forming multiple stable hydrogen bond networks. Therefore, breaking and reforming of these hydrogen bonds will no doubt contribute to latent heat of SA when they change from solid to liquid. Our results not only are helpful for understanding phase transition behaviors of phase change materials in nanocapsule interface confinement conditions but also provide a good example to develop new types of heat energy storage composite materials. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Light metal tetrahydroborates are regarded as promising materials for solid state hydrogen storage. Due to both a high gravimetric hydrogen capacity of 11.5 wt % and an ideal dehydrogenation enthalpy of 32 kJ mol-1 H 2, Ca(BH4)2 is considered to be one of the most interesting compounds in this class of materials. In this work, a comprehensive investigation of the effect of different selected additives (TiF4, NbF5, Ti-isopropoxide, and CaF2) on the reversible hydrogenation reaction of calcium borohydride is presented combining different investigation techniques. The chemical state of the Nb- and Ti-based additives is studied by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (e.g., XANES). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was used to show the local structure, size, and distribution of the additive/catalyst. 11B{1H} solid state magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) was carried out to detect possible amorphous phases. The formation of TiB 2 and NbB2 nanoparticles was observed after milling or upon sorption reactions of the Nb- and Ti-based Ca(BH4)2 doped systems. The formation of transition-metal boride nanoparticles is proposed to support the heterogeneous nucleation of CaB6.

 Abstract:  Surface in and ex situ analysis have shown that in the course of cathodic oxygen reduction (ORR), all along the reversible potential range (the low slope Tafel plots, about 30 mVs/dec), nanostructured Pt electrocatalyst is covered by the interfering primary (Pt-OH) and surface (Pt=O) oxide mixture, while the higher polarization (120 mVs/dec) characterizes electrocatalytic surface deprived from these oxides and, consequently, the reaction mechanism of direct electron exchange on clean electrode surface. The substantial difference between the standard RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) and ROE (reversible oxygen electrode), is that the former implies spontaneous hydrogen adsorption, fast H-adatoms (Pt-H) effusion and reversible electrode behavior (Pt(H 2)/Pt-H/H3O+), while the latter features the strong irreversible Pt=O adsorptive strength, and which is more significant, missing the Pt-OH spillover within the critical potential range between the primary oxide adsorption/desorption peaks position and oxygen evolving limits in both potentiodynamic scan directions (or the imposed polarization energy barrier of about 600 mVs). Since the Pt-OH presence and spillover are unavoidable decisive and indispensable for establishing the ROE properties, and thermodynamic electrode equilibrium (Pt(O2)/Pt-OH/Pt=O/OH -), within the pronounced high polarization broad potential range, such spillover species has the same meaning and significance for the ROE as Pt-H plays for the RHE. Thence, to fill such a high polarization gap, the guiding concept implies homogeneous nanostructured distribution and selective grafting while interactive hypo-hyper-d-d-interelectronic bonding of Pt nanoclusters upon various mixed valence hypo-d-oxide supports, primarily Nb2O 5,TiO2 (or Ta2O5,TiO2), because of their much thermally advanced electronic conductivity and extra high stability. In such a constellation, nanoparticles of Pt and solid oxides establish the so-called SMSIs (strong metal-support interactions), the strongest ones in all of chemistry, together with advanced electron conductive transfer, while the exposed surface of the latter undergoes spontaneous dissociative adsorption of water molecules (Nb2O5 → 2 Nb(OH) 5), and thereby becomes, along with continuous further water vapor supply, the undisturbed and almost unlimited, (alike electrons in metals) renewable latent storage and spillover source of the Pt-OH all along the potential axis between oxygen and hydrogen evolving limits, with inexhaustible abilities of further optimizations. The reversible alterpolar changes instantaneously result by the spillover of H-adatoms with corresponding bronze type (Pt/HxNbO5, x ≈ 0.3) electrocatalysts under cathodic, and/or its hydrated state (Pt/Nb(OH)5), responsible for Pt-OH effusion, under anodic polarization. This way there establishes the reversibly revertible alterpolar bronze features (Pt/HxNbO 5 ↔ Pt/Nb(OH)5), as the thermodynamic equilibrium, and thereby substantially advanced electrocatalytic properties of these composite interactive electrocatalysts for both oxygen and hydrogen electrode reactions, in particular unique and superior for the revertible (proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) versus water electrolysis (WE)) cells. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

This feature is desirable for several technological applications such as solid state hydrogen storage tanks and anodes of nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) batteries. For the latter, Mg-Ni alloys are considered very promising due to their high discharge capacities. Conversely, the low stability of Mg-Ni alloys in alkaline electrolytes have hindered their practical use. In the present manuscript, the effects of palladium black addition on the structure and electrochemical properties of the Mg50Ni50 (in at.%) alloy were investigated. The studied ternary alloys have general composition of Mg50Ni(50-x)Pdx, with 0 ≤ x ≤ 5 (in at.%). These alloys were synthesized by mechanical alloying from pure elements. The alloy powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) while their electrode performances were evaluated by galvanostatic cycles of charge and discharge. The investigated alloys have multi-phase structures composed of amorphous and nanocrystalline phases, with nano-grain sizes of nearly 5 nm. Concerning the electrode performance, the best results were attained by the Mg50Ni47.5Pd2.5 alloy, which kept a high discharge capacity and improved the cycling stability. © 2013 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.

 Abstract:  Multiple reaction mixtures with different composition ratios of MCl 3-LiBH 4 (M = La, Gd) were studied by mechano-chemical synthesis, yielding two new bimetallic borohydride chlorides, LiM(BH 4) 3Cl (M = La, Gd). The Gd-containing phase was obtained only after annealing the ball-milled mixture. Additionally, a solvent extracted sample of Gd(BH 4) 3 was studied to gain insight into the transformation from Gd(BH 4) 3 to LiGd(BH 4) 3Cl. The novel compounds were investigated using in situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis combined with mass spectroscopy, Sieverts measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The two new compounds, LiLa(BH 4) 3Cl and LiGd(BH 4) 3Cl, have high lithium ion conductivities of 2.3 ×10 -4 and 3.5 ×10 -4 S•cm -1 (T = 20 °C) and high hydrogen densities of ρ m = 5.36 and 4.95 wt % H 2, and both compounds crystallize in the cubic crystal system (space group I-43m) with unit cell parameter a = 11.7955(1) and a = 11.5627(1) Å, respectively. The structures contain isolated tetranuclear anionic clusters [M 4Cl 4(BH 4) 12] 4- with distorted cubane M 4Cl 4 cores M = La or Gd. Each lanthanide atom coordinates three chloride ions and three borohydride groups, thus completing the coordination environment to an octahedron. The Li + ions are disordered on 2/3 of the 12d Wyckoff site, which agrees well with the very high lithium ion conductivities. The conductivity is purely ionic, as electronic conductivities were measured to only 1.4 ×10 -8 and 9 ×10 -8 S•cm -1 at T = 20 °C for LiLa(BH 4) 3Cl and LiGd(BH 4) 3Cl, respectively. In situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD) reveals that the decomposition products at 300 °C consist of LaB 6/LaH 2 or GdB 4/GdH 2 and LiCl.

 Abstract:  Particle size and particle-framework interactions have profound effects on the kinetics, reaction pathways, and even thermodynamics of complex hydrides incorporated in frameworks possessing nanoscale features. Tuning these properties may hold the key to the utilization of complex hydrides in practical applications for hydrogen storage. Using carefully synthesized, highly-ordered, nanoporous carbons (NPCs), we have previously shown quantitative differences in the kinetics and reaction pathways of LiBH4 when incorporated into the frameworks. In this paper, we probe the anion mobility of LiBH4 confined in NPC frameworks by a combination of solid state NMR and quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) and present some new insights into the nanoconfinement effect. NMR and QENS spectra of LiBH4 confined in a 4 nm pore NPC suggest that the BH4- anions nearer the LiBH 4-carbon pore interface exhibit much more rapid translational and reorientational motions compared to those in the LiBH4 interior. Moreover, an overly broadened BH4- torsional vibration band reveals a disorder-induced array of BH4- rotational potentials. XRD results are consistent with a lack of LiBH4 long-range order in the pores. Consistent with differential scanning calorimetry measurements, neither NMR nor QENS detects a clear solid-solid phase transition as observed in the bulk, indicating that borohydride-framework interactions and/or nanosize effects have large roles in confined LiBH4. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Controlling the dehydrogenation process in a suitable reaction route by choosing the appropriate reaction conditions is crucial for a hydrogen storage system. The dehydrogenation process of the eutectic 0.68LiBH4-0. 32Ca(BH4)2 mixture was investigated by dynamic pressure-composition isotherms, X-ray diffraction, and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance in order to determine the optimal reaction route for the dehydrogenation and to improve the hydrogen absorption reaction. In a temperature range from 330 to 450 C, the LiBH4-Ca(BH 4)2 mixture decomposes in two major steps. First, Ca(BH4)2 decomposes into CaH2, CaB6, CaB12H12, H2, and probably amorphous boron. Second, CaH2 reacts with LiBH4 to CaB6, LiH, and H2. Li2B12H12 has been identified as a byproduct. It was observed that the lower dehydrogenation temperature, the more CaB6 and the less [B12H 12]2- containing phases are present in the final dehydrogenation products, resulting in improved absorption performance. The temperature dependence is discussed, providing instructions to improve reversibility for potential applications and new insights into the hydrogen sorption mechanism of metal borohydrides. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

"Seperate the questions with commasTitle:Hydrogen storage capacity loss in a LiBH4-Al composite
 Abstract:  A detailed investigation of the decomposition reactions and decay in the hydrogen storage capacity during repeated hydrogen release and uptake cycles for the reactive composite LiBH4-Al (2:3) is presented. Furthermore, the influence of a titanium boride, TiB2, additive is investigated. The study combines information from multiple techniques: in situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction, Sieverts measurements, simultaneous thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and mass spectroscopy, solid-state magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR), and Raman spectroscopy. The decomposition of LiBH4-Al results in the formation of LiAl, AlB2, and Li2B 12H12 via several reactions and intermediate compounds. The TiB2 additive appears to have a limited effect on the decomposition pathway of the samples, but seems to facilitate formation of intermediate species at lower temperatures compared to the sample without additive. Solid solutions of LixAl1-xB2 or Al1-xB2 are observed during decomposition and from Rietveld refinement the composition of the solid solution is estimated to be Li0.22Al0.78B2. The intercalation of Li in the AlB2 structure is further investigated by11B and 27Al MAS NMR spectra of the LiH-AlB2 and AlB2 samples (presented in Supporting Information). Hydrogen release and uptake for LiBH4-Al reveals a significant loss in the hydrogen storage capacity, that is, after four cycles a capacity of about 45% remains, and after 10 cycles, the capacity is degraded to approximately 15% of the theoretically available hydrogen content. This capacity loss may be due to the formation of Li2B12H12, as observed by11B MAS NMR and Raman spectroscopy. Formation of Li2B12H12 has previously been observed during the decomposition of LiBH4, but it has not been reported earlier in the LiBH4-Al (2:3) system. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

"Seperate the questions with commasTitle:Hydrogen storage materials
 Abstract:  Hydrogen generated by using renewable energy sources has great potential to be an alternate fuel, thereby reducing the dependence on fossil fuel. Hydrogen is a clean, nonpolluting fuel without any greenhouse gas emission. The criteria for a good hydrogen storage system for vehicular applications are good gravimetric and volumetric storage capacity, fast kinetics for absorption and desorption, equilibrium plateau pressure close to 1 atmosphere, low desorption temperature, easy activation, low hysteresis, good recyclability, good thermal and mechanical stability during the cycling operation, and low cost. There are three ways to store hydrogen: compressed gas; cryogenic liquid hydrogen (LH2); and solid-state hydrogen storage. Hydrogen can be stored in the form of compressed gas at high pressures of ∼150-200 atmosphere. Special hydrogen cylinders are available for very high pressures up to 700 atmosphere. In liquid form, hydrogen can be stored at a cryogenic temperature of 20 K, which is energy intensive. Liquid hydrogen is highly volatile and the evaporated hydrogen gas can form an explosive mixture with air. The main drawback of both these methods is the low volume density of hydrogen. Metal hydrides offer a convenient and safe technology for hydrogen storage. The fact that the density of hydrogen per unit volume is highest in metal hydrides and the stored hydrogen can be released at the desired temperature makes it superior to liquid hydrogen or hydrogen cylinders. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

 Abstract:  Cryogenic slush fluids, such as slush hydrogen and slush nitrogen, are two-phase, single-component fluids containing solid particles in a liquid. Since their density and refrigerant capacity are greater than those of liquid-state fluids alone, there are high expectations for use of slush fluids as functionally thermal fluids in various applications, such as fuels for spacecraft engines, clean energy fuels to improve the efficiency of transportation and storage, and as refrigerants for high-temperature superconducting equipment. In this research, a three-dimensional numerical simulation code (SLUSH-3D), including the gravity effect based on the thermal non-equilibrium, two-fluid model, was constructed to clarify the flow and heat-transfer characteristics of cryogenic slush fluids in a horizontal circular pipe. The calculated results of slush nitrogen flow performed using the numerical code were compared with the authors' experimental results obtained using the PIV method. As a result of these comparisons, the numerical code was verified, making it possible to analyze the flow and heat-transfer characteristics of slush nitrogen with sufficient accuracy. The numerical results obtained for the flow and heat-transfer characteristics of slush nitrogen and slush hydrogen clarified the effects of the pipe inlet velocity, solid fraction, solid particle size, and heat flux on the flow pattern, solid-fraction distribution, turbulence energy, pressure drop, and heat-transfer coefficient. Furthermore, it became clear that the difference of the flow and heat-transfer characteristics between slush nitrogen and slush hydrogen were caused to a large extent by their thermo-physical properties, such as the solid-liquid density ratio, liquid viscosity, and latent heat of fusion. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

 Abstract:  Nanoscale, amorphous LiBH4 powder with sizes from 20 to 50 nm is synthesized via a solvent evaporation process without the aid of nanoscaffolds. The nanoscale LiBH4 starts to release H2 at ∼32 °C and forms Li2B12H12 at 265 °C or lower. The amount of H2 released in the solid state from 25 to 265 °C reaches 3.5 wt.%, which is substantially higher than 0.75 wt.% H 2 released by bulk LiBH4.

 Abstract:  The present review of the most recent patents outlines the progress made over the last five years in the search of novel materials and processes that might allow large amounts of hydrogen to be stored on board of vehicles. Worth of note are the results of certain abinitio calculations proving that some compounds not yet synthesized might, actually, show features approaching the requirements of the US Department of Energy. Significant progress has been made concerning the absorption/desorption reversibility of Li-N-H compounds (amides/imides, LiH, Li3N), borohydrides and boranes. These materials, at the actual state of the art, appear still largely inadequate to comply with DOE targets. However, their intrinsic high mass capacity offers wide margin for further research in this area. The achievements made with alanates, magnesium-based hydrides and bcc-alloy hydrides, although of great significance from a point of view of the fundamental research, nonetheless, appear to be of limited impact from a practical point of view, at least for automotive applications.

 Abstract:  Light element complex hydrides (e.g. NaBH4) together with metal hydrides (e.g. MgH2) are considered two primary classes of solid state hydrogen storage materials. In spite of drawbacks such as unfavorable thermodynamics and poor kinetics, enhancements may occur in reactive hydride composites by nanostructuring of reactant phases and formation of more stable product phases (e.g. MgB2) which lower overall reaction enthalpy and allow reversibility. One potential system is based on mixing NaBH4 and MgH2 and subsequent ball milling, which in a 2:1 molar ratio can store considerable amounts of hydrogen by weight (up to 7.8 wt%). A study of the 2NaBX4 + MgX2 → MgB2 + 2NaX + 4X 2 (X=D,H) reaction is assessed by means of in-situ neutron diffraction with different combinations of hydrogen and deuterium on the X position. The desorption is established to begin at temperatures as low as 250 °C, starting with decomposition of nanostructured MgX2 due to joint effects of nanostructured MgX2 and its reducing effect at NaBX4. Analyses of background profile, due to the high incoherent neutron scattering of hydrogen, as a function of temperature demonstrate direct correlation of H/D desorption reactions with relative phases amount. © 2010 Materials Research Society.

 Abstract:  Sodium alanate NaAlH4 is a very suitable material for solid-state hydrogen storage owing to its relatively high hydrogen capacity (7.5 wt.% H2) and moderate temperatures for reversible H2 release/uptake (100-150 °C) compatible with PEM fuel cells. These temperatures are obtained by adding a dopant. TiCl3, ScCl3 or CeCl3 are known to be efficient dopants but the details of the catalytic mechanism are not fully understood yet. In this work, the H 2 sorption of NaAlH4 doped with TiCl3, ScCl3 or CeCl3 is systematically studied. The doped samples were prepared in one step by reactive ball milling of NaH and Al with 4 mol.% dopant in an H2 atmosphere. The efficiencies of the dopants are different for desorption and absorption, indicating that different catalytic mechanisms and rate limiting steps are taking place during both steps and these are described here. TiCl3 is more efficient for desorption and CeCl3 for absorption. ScCl3 is less efficient than the first two for all reactions. A mixture of TiCl3 and CeCl3 is thus added to NaAlH4 to act at the same time on the desorption and the absorption processes. The results show enhanced overall performances for H2 sorption when using this mixture compared to NaAlH4 milled with TiCl3 or CeCl3 only. © 2010 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

 Abstract:  In the search for suitable solid state hydrogen storage systems, NaAlH 4 (7.4 wt % H2) holds great promise due to its suitable thermodynamical properties. However, hydrogen release and uptake are hampered by high activation energies, most likely due to solid state mass transfer limitations.

We prepared high loadings of nanosized NaAlH4 confined in the pores of a carbon support by melt infiltration. XRD, nitrogen physisorption, high pressure DSC and solid-state NMR are used to evidence that the molten NaAlH4 infiltrates the carbon support, and forms a nanosized NaAlH4 phase lacking long-range order. The confined NaAlH4 shows enhanced hydrogen dehydrogenation properties and rehydrogenation under mild conditions that is attributed to the nanosize and close contact to the carbon matrix. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Metal borohydrides are potential materials for solid-state hydrogen due to their high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen densities. Among them, Ca(BH4)2 is particularly interesting because of the predicted suitable thermodynamic properties. In this work, we investigate a new synthesis route using high-pressure reactive ball milling. Starting from CaH2 and CaB6 with a TiCl3 or TiF3 as additive, a reaction yield of 19% is obtained after 24 h milling at room temperature and 140 bar H2. The presence of Ca(BH4)2 is confirmed by the presence of the stretching mode of the [BH4]- group in the infrared spectra of the as-milled samples. Using in situ XRD, we observe the recrystallisation of a poorly crystallised Ca(BH4)2 phase present after milling. The reversible decomposition/formation of Ca(BH4)2 is obtained with higher yield (57%) using higher temperature and TiF3 as additive but not with TiCl3 despite its similar electronic structure.

 Abstract:  The present work deals with two essential degradation mechanisms of zirconium alloys: Hydrogen behavior and microstructural transformations due to neutron irradiation. The studies were carried out by using samples taken from Zircaloy-4 components, which remained for 14 years in the Atucha I pressurized heavy water reactor, accumulating neutron fluences of up to 1022 neutrons/cm2. A hydrogen/deuterium solubility increase was observed in both dissolution and precipitation processes. With the aim to follow this evolution with radiation damage recovery, the irradiated samples were annealed for different periods at 350 and 400°C in a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). These temperatures were chosen to reproduce those reached by spent fuels in the early stages of the dry storage (DS). Between intervals, the terminal solid solubility temperatures in dissolution (TTSSd) and in precipitation (TTSSp) were determined. They were also determined after additional annealing at 500 and 600°C, trying to simulate long periods at DS. The hydride morphology and the metallurgical state of the Zr(Fe,Cr) 2 second-phase particles (SPPs) were followed between annealing by optical microscopy, analytical electron microscopy, synchrotron light X-ray diffraction4 (SXRD), and DSC. As a brief summary, we found from the first to the last run of the annealing sequence an increase of 55°C in TTSSd and 40°C in TTSSp on average. The optical and transmission electron microscopies (TEM) indicate that in the material in the irradiated condition, exists a hydride size distribution of four orders of magnitude, from 10 nm to 100 μm, but biased to sizes smaller than 5 μm. A complete amorphisation of the SPPs was observed in high fluence samples by TEM and SXRD. Similar TEM observations made in irradiated samples annealed above 400°C show a re-precipitation process of nano-SPPs forming clusters. The reprecipitation is affected by kinetics: The SPPs crystallization temperature, Tc, rises from 450 to 500°C as the heating rate increases from 5 to 20°C/min.

 Abstract:  MgH2 is a promising material for solid-state hydrogen storage due to its high gravimetric and volumetric storage capacity and its relatively low cost. Severe plastic deformation (SPD) processing techniques are being explored as an alternative to high-energy ball-milling (HEBM) in order to obtain more air resistant materials and reduce processing times. In this work, Mg, MgH2, and MgH2-Fe mixtures were severely mechanically processed by different techniques such as high-pressure torsion (HPT), extensive cold forging, and cold rolling. A very significant grain refinement was achieved when using MgH2 instead of Mg as raw material. The mean crystallite sizes observed ranged from 10 to 30 nm, depending on the processing conditions. Enhanced H-sorption properties were observed for the MgH 2-based nanocomposites processed by HPT when compared with MgH 2 mixtures. Additionally, cold forging and cold rolling also proved effective in nanostructuring MgH2. These results suggest a high potential for innovative application with the use of low cost mechanical processing routes to produce Mg-based nanomaterials with attractive hydrogen storage properties. © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

 Abstract:  Mechanochemical transformations occurring during ball milling of sodium amide (NaNH 2) with magnesium hydride (MgH 2) taken in 2:3 and 2:1 molar ratios have been investigated using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) techniques. For the 2NaNH 2-3MgH 2 system the mechanochemical reaction proceeds via the formation of MgNH as an intermediate, whereas magnesium nitride (Mg 3N 2), sodium hydride (NaH) and hydrogen (∼5 wt%) form as the final products. The overall solid state reaction for this system is 2NaNH 2 + 3MgH 2 → Mg 3N 2 + 2NaH + 4H 2. However, the mechanochemical transformation of the 2NaNH 2-MgH 2 system proceeds through the reaction: 2NaNH 2 + MgH 2 → Mg(NH 2) 2 + 2NaH, without any hydrogen release. Comparison of the mechanochemical transformations with the previously studied thermochemical transformations reveals that the two approaches lead to the same final products via different reaction pathways. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen vibrational excitation was studied for CaF2-type metal hydrides synthesized from Ti-based BCC solid solution alloys using inelastic incoherent neutron scattering (IINS). Ti1.0V1.1Mn 0.9H4.5 and Ti1.0V1.2Cr 1.1H4.8 showed UNS spectra similar to that reported for TiH2. The first three peaks were isolated but the higher excitation peaks were not clear. Analysis of the spectra using curve-fitting with Gauss functions revealed that the hydrogen vibration of Ti1.0V 1.1Mn0.9H4.5 is harmonic but that of the TÍ0.7V12CrIiH48 is deviated from harmonic, which reflects a trumpet-type potential. The relation between metal-hydrogen distance and vibrational excitation energy for the above two hydrides and Ti1.1Cr 1.4Mo0.9H4.8 was compared with a series of CaF2-type binary metal hydrides. All the hydrides of the Ti-based alloys had lower vibrational excitation energies than the binary metal hydrides for the corresponding metal-hydrogen distances. ©2011 The Japan Institute of Metals.

 Abstract:  Storage of molecular hydrogen in solid media often depends on the interaction between metal cations and H2. Under these circumstances, the strength of the interaction can conveniently be assessed from the frequency of the H2 vibration. Here we investigate the gas-phase Ag +-H2 complex, focusing on the relationship between its binding energy and the H2 subunit?s stretch frequency. The infrared spectrum of Ag+-H2 is recorded in the H-H stretch region by detecting Ag+ photofragments resulting from resonant excitation. Analysis of the partially rotationally resolved spectrum, taking upper state perturbations into account, confirms a T-shaped equilibrium geometry and an intermolecular separation of 2.02 Å. The vibrational band center is shifted by -405.7 ± 1.5 cm-1 relative to the free H 2 molecule. A new trend connecting the H-H band shift and H 2 binding energy is identified for metal cation-H2 complexes containing filled or half-filled valence d orbitals. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) nanocomposites were prepared by solution blending method, and the melt viscoelastic behavior of the composites was studied. The results showed that the dispersion of MWCNTs in the matrix and the surface characteristic of MWCNTs had a profound influence on the melt rheological behaviors of the nanocomposites. Generally, the dynamic storage modulus (G′) of the nanocomposites with well dispersed MWCNTs was greatly improved. However, PVDF/MWCNTs-g-OH nanocomposites exhibit more significant solid-like behavior than PVDF/MWCNTs nanocomposites at an MWCNTs loading of 2 wt % or higher, even though the dispersion of MWCNTs-g-OH is poorer than that of virgin MWCNTs owing to the higher interfacial interactions from van der Waals force and hydrogen bonding. In this case, the influence of the interfacial interactions on the melt rheological properties was stronger than the dispersion state. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

 Abstract:  Nanostructured materials have opened up new possibilities for solving the storage problem. Their high porosities make them promising candidates for reaching the required storage capacities, and the small dimensions involved reduce the time taken for the hydrogen molecules to travel from their resident site to the surface. Owing to their light weight and high porosities, carbonbased nanostructured materials have been intensively investigated as potential hydrogen storage media over the past two decades. Several update reports and reviews already exist in the literature [3-18], where the emphasis has been placed on a detailed account of the ultimate hydrogen-storage performance of a vast range of substrates and synthesis protocols, to the detriment of building a consistent and robust microscopic picture of how molecular hydrogen interacts with these materials. This tutorial review is intended to fill the above gap by shifting the focus to the hydrogen molecule. As such, the intent is to be illustrative rather than exhaustive in our exposition of the state of the art in the field. To this end, Section 40.2 discusses in detail both the molecular and bulk properties of hydrogen and the various ways it interacts with solid-state media. Both experimental and theoretical tools are also introduced in some detail, particularly those that can offer novel insight into the hydrogen-storage problem. These topics are illustrated in detail by working out specific examples of direct relevance to the use of carbon-based nanomaterials. Section 40.3 makes extensive use of the fundamental principles introduced earlier on. First, it explores the topological consequences of rolling and bending graphite the basis of constructing novel forms of carbon. The effects of topology and chemical doping are then treated in detail by presenting two case studies taken from our recent work.

 Abstract:  Experimental work was undertaken to evaluate the long-term corrosion behaviour of a carbon steel used fuel container in postulated Canadian deep geological repository environments. Specifically, atmospheric corrosion testing was conducted in anoxic atmospheres at 30, 50 and 70°C, over a wide range of relative humidity (30-100% RH). Hydrogen evolved from steel corrosion was initially monitored with a high sensitivity pressure gauge system (the sensitivity of such measurements is ca. 0.005 μm y-1) and later using a solid-state electrochemical hydrogen sensor (the hydrogen sensor can detect the pressure increase down to a limit of ca. 0.1 Pa corresponding to a corrosion rate as low as ca. 0.0001 μm y-1). Results observed in this study indicate that it is highly likely that the corrosion rate will fall below 1 nm y-1 within a year once an anoxic condition is attained. In parallel with the corrosion experiments, corrosion product surface analyses were performed using (i) scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM/EDX) to determine the morphology of the corrosion product films, (ii) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to identify the chemical composition of the films, and (iii) Raman and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to study bonding. Oxides formed on steel surfaces were found to consist mostly of Fe3O4, with some Fe(III) species from traces of air exposure; carbonate was detected on the NaCl contaminated surfaces which had been subject to a degree of prior aerobic corrosion. A high humidity (100%) environment produces more loose surface oxide than a lower humidity environment (75%).

 Abstract:  Mg-based nanocrystalline alloys or nanocomposites are promising materials for hydrogen storage in the solid state, which is a more effective and safer storage medium than pressurized or liquefied hydrogen. Among the many Mg-based hydrides of interest for hydrogen storage, Mg2FeH6 is in a special position due to its relatively high gravimetric capacity of 5.5% and excellent volumetric density of 150 kg H2/m3. This work involved a study of the synthesis and processing of Mg-based alloys of this type, produced by high-energy ball milling and hot extrusion. A mixture of 2Mg-Fe was prepared by high-energy ball milling under argon gas. The resulting powder was cold-pressed to produce cylindrical pre-forms, which were then extruded and the sorption properties were analyzed in a microbalance and in a Sieverts apparatus. Phase formation, microstructural evolution, desorption temperatures, and hydrogen storage capacity were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric techniques. The results showed that Mg2FeH 6 was formed and the hydrogen reaction was reversible. SEM observations indicate a microstructure composed of nanosized grains in the range of 30-80 nm inside particles of about 50 μm, and Mg2FeH 6 formed mainly at the particle interfaces. The desorption temperature started at about 225 °C, reaching a maximum at 440 °C with low capacity of absorption, indicating low absorption/desorption kinetics, probably due to bulk diffusion limitations. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is considered to be one of the most promising options for a solid state hydrogen storage material. However, for practical use it is still imperative to find a convenient means of overcoming its slow kinetics and high stability. In this investigation, oxide materials based on TiO2 have been prepared from alkoxide precursors using a sol-gel route. When ball milled with MgH2, the titanium oxide based additives were found to result in significantly reduced onset temperatures of dehydrogenation and increased hydrogenation and dehydrogenation rates. Dehydrogenation onset temperatures as low as 257 °C were observed, which is over 100 °C lower than for milled MgH2 with no additives. In cycling experiments at 300 °C, between pressures of 1 × 10-2 bar H2 and 6 bar H2, reaction rates for dehydrogenation and hydrogenation were found to be up to 15 times quicker than for milled MgH2 with no additives. The Ti based oxide additives were found to change the mechanism of dehydrogenation from milled MgH2 from one of surface control followed by contracting volume, to a two-dimensional Johnson-Mehl-Avrami nucleation and growth mechanism. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Magnesium complex hydrides as Mg2FeH6 are interesting phases for hydrogen storage in the solid state, mainly due to its high gravimetric and volumetric densities of H2. However, the synthesis of this hydride is not trivial because the intermetallic phase Mg2Fe does not exist and Mg and Fe are virtually immiscible under equilibrium conditions. In this study, we have systematically studied the influence of the most important processing parameters in reactive milling under hydrogen (RM) for Mg2FeH 6 synthesis: milling time, ball-to-powder weight ratio (BPR), hydrogen pressure and type of mill. Low cost 2Mg-Fe mixtures were used as raw materials. An important control of the Mg2FeH6 direct synthesis by RM was attained. In optimized combinations of the processing parameters, very high proportions of the complex hydride could be obtained. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

 Abstract:  Complex hydrides are very promising candidates for future light-weight solid state hydrogen storage materials. The present work illustrates detailed characterization of such novel hydride materials on different size scales by the use of synchrotron radiation and neutrons. The comprehensive analysis of such data leads to a deep understanding of the ongoing processes and mechanisms. The reaction pathways during hydrogen desorption and absorption are identified by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD). Function and size of additive phases are estimated using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and anomalous small-angle X-ray scattering (ASAXS). The structure of the metal hydride matrix is characterized using (ultra) small-angle neutron scattering (SANS/USANS). The hydrogen distribution in tanks filled with metal hydride material is studied with neutron computerized tomography (NCT). The results obtained by the different analysis methods are summarized in a final structural model. The complementary information obtained by these different methods is essential for the understanding of the various sorption processes in light metal hydrides and hydrogen storage tanks.

 Abstract:  The thermodynamic treatment of adsorption phenomena is based on the Gibbs dividing surface, which is conceptually clear for a flat surface. On a flat surface, the primary extensive property is the area of the solid. As applications became more significant, necessitating microporous solids, early researchers such as McBain and Coolidge implemented the Gibbs definition by invoking a reference state for microporous solids. The mass of solid is used as a primary extensive property because surface area loses its physical meaning for microporous solids. A reference state is used to fix the hypothetical hyperdividing surface typically using helium as a probe molecule, resulting in the commonly used excess adsorption; experimentalists measure this reference state for each new sample. Molecular simulations, however, provide absolute adsorption. Theoreticians perform helium simulations to convert absolute to excess adsorption, mimicking experiments for comparison. This current structure of adsorption thermodynamics is rigorous (if the conditions for reference state helium measurements are completely disclosed) but laborious. In addition, many studies show that helium, or any other probe molecule for that matter, does adsorb, albeit to a small extent. We propose a novel thermodynamic framework, net adsorption, which completely circumvents the use of probe molecules to fix the reference state for each microporous sample. Using net adsorption, experimentalists calibrate their apparatus only once without any sample in the system. Theoreticians can directly calculate net adsorption; no additional simulations with a probe gas are necessary. Net adsorption also provides a direct indication of the density enhancement achieved (by using an adsorbent) over simple compression for gas (e.g., hydrogen) storage applications. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Anion substitution is at present one of the pathways to destabilize metal borohydrides for solid state hydrogen storage. In this work, a solid solution of LiBH4 and LiCl is studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, thermodynamic modeling, X-ray diffraction, and infrared spectroscopy. It is shown that Cl substitution has minor effects on thermodynamic stability of either the orthorhombic or the hexagonal phase of LiBH4. The transformation into the orthorhombic phase in LiBH4 shortly after annealing with LiCl is for the first time followed by infrared measurements. Our findings are in a good agreement with an experimental study of the LiBH4-LiCl solid solution structure and dynamics. This demonstrates the validity of the adopted combined theoretical (DFT calculations) and experimental (vibrational spectroscopy) approach, to investigate the solid solution formation of complex hydrides. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

 Abstract:  In the present study, the effects of TiCl 3 on desorption kinetics, absorption/desorption reversibility, and related phase transformation processes in LiBH 4/CaH 2/TiCl 3 hydrogen storage system was studied systematically by varying its concentration (x = 0, 0.05, 0.15 and 0.25). The results show that LiCl forms during ball milling of 6LiBH 4/CaH 2/xTiCl 3 and that as temperature increases, o-LiBH 4 transforms into h-LiBH 4, into which LiCl incorporates, forming solid solution of LiBH 4·LiCl, which melts above 280 °C. Molten LiBH 4·LiCl is more viscous than molten LiBH 4, preventing the clustering of LiBH 4 and the accompanied agglomeration of CaH 2, and thus preserving the nano-sized phase arrangement formed during ball milling. Above 350 °C, the molten solution LiBH 4·LiCl further reacts with CaH 2, precipitating LiCl. The main hydrogen desorption reaction is between molten LiBH 4·LiCl and CaH 2 and not between molten LiBH 4 and CaH 2. This alters the hydrogen reaction thermodynamics and lowers the hydrogen desorption temperature. In addition, the solid-liquid nano-sized phase arrangement in the nano-composites improves the hydrogen reaction kinetics. The reversible incorporation/precipitation of LiCl at the hydrogen reaction temperature and during temperature cycling makes the 6LiBH 4/CaH 2/0.25TiCl 3 nano-composite a fully reversible hydrogen storage material. These four states of LiCl in LiBH 4/CaH 2/TiCl 3 system, i.e. ""formed-solid solution-molten solution-precipitation"", are reported for the first time and the detailed study of this system is beneficial to further improve hydrogen storage property of complex hydrides. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Among the borohydrides proposed for solid state hydrogen storage, Ca(BH4)2 is particularly interesting because of its favourable thermodynamics and relatively cheap price. Composite systems, where other species are present in addition to the borohydride, show some advantages in hydrogen sorption properties with respect to the borohydrides alone, despite a reduction of the theoretical storage capacity. We have investigated the milling time influence on the sorption properties of the CaH2 + MgB2 system from which Ca(BH4)2 and MgH 2 can be synthesized by hydrogen absorption process. Manometric and calorimetric measurements showed better kinetics for long time milled samples. We found that the total substitution of MgB2 with AlB2 in the starting material can improve the sorption properties significantly, while the co-existence of both magnesium and aluminum borides in the starting mixture did not cause any improvement.

 Abstract:  Percolation phenomena in bionanocomposites composed of the bioplastic polylactide and surface decorated supramolecular multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are investigated. MWCNTs with three distinct surface chemistries-a native surface, a hydroxyl functionalized surface, and a short hydrocarbon functionalized surface-are prepared and studied. Two experimental methods are used to determine percolation thresholds; melt rheology provides a measure of the mechanical percolation threshold and electrical impedance spectroscopy provides values of the electrical percolation threshold. The MWCNT-loading level required to obtain mechanical percolation is systematically found to be lower than the loading level needed to achieve electrical percolation. Hydroxylated MWCNTs have the highest percolation thresholds of 1.8 (mechanical) and 6.7 wt % (electrical), which is attributed to aggregation caused by hydrogen bonding. Alkane-grafted MWCNTs have lower percolation thresholds of 0.76 (mechanical) and 2.8 wt % (electrical). However, untreated MWCNTs have the lowest thresholds of 0.16 (mechanical) and 1.5 wt % (electrical). The reduced percolation threshold observed upon conversion of the hydroxylated surface to the alkylated surface is attributed to morphological differences-functionalization disrupts hydrogen bonding and leads to better nanotube dispersion. The combination of higher inherent conductivity and more favorable nanotube-polylactide interactions implies that unmodified MWCNTs are preferred to produce electrically conductive bionanocomposites. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

 Abstract:  The preparation of Li11BD4 from Al11B2, LiD and D2 and several subsequent hydrogen sorption cycles according to 2 LiD + AlB2 + 3 D2 ↔ 2 LiBD4 + Al starting from the desorbed state are investigated by in situ neutron diffraction. Absorption is carried out at T = 450° C and at p = 50 bar D2, while desorption is performed at T = 450° C using a back-pressure of 1 bar. Compared to the Al free system, the absorption is observed at much lower temperatures and pressures. We attribute the increased deuterium uptake to the enhanced chemical reactivity of the elemental boron released in the dissociation of AlB2. The desorption process on the other hand is similar to the desorption of pure LiBD4 and seems not to be influenced by the present aluminum. The hydrogen capacity decreases from cycle to cycle, due to an incomplete re-formation of AlB2.

 Abstract:  Organic thermal energy storage materials are useful for thermal energy storage due to the presence of solid-state phase transition where the latent heat can store energy. The effects of temperature and pressure on the X-ray diffraction patterns and Raman spectra of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS, C(CH2OH)3NH2) were measured. X-ray diffraction and DSC results show that the solid state phase transition (α- orthorhombic to γ-BCC) of TRIS occurs at 133.7C at ambient pressure (1 atm).

 Abstract:  The Mg-Co mixture was milled using a low energy mill during 200 h under argon and then submitted to thermal treatment. The mechanical milling (MM) of Mg-Co mixture leads to microstructural refinement reducing the diffusion distances and then favoring the kinetics of solid-state reaction. As a consequence, the formation of MgCo compound occurs at temperatures of 573 K which is lower than previously reported. As-milled sample (Mg and Co phases) and as-milled plus heated sample (with mainly MgCo compound) were non-isothermally heated under hydrogen pressure using high-pressure differential scanning calorimetric equipment. The presence of MgCo intermetallic compound improves the reactivity with hydrogen, reducing both hydrogen absorption and desorption temperature, as well as increasing the total hydrogen storage capacity.

 Abstract:  Ammonia borane (AB) is under significant investigation as a possible hydrogen storage material. While chemical additives have been shown to lower the temperature for hydrogen release from ammonia borane, many provide additional complications in the regeneration cycle. Mechanically alloyed hexagonal boron nitride (nano-BN) has been shown to facilitate the release of hydrogen from AB at lower temperature, with minimal induction time and less exothermicity, and inert nano-BN may be easily removed during any regeneration of the spent AB. The samples were prepared by mechanically alloying AB with nano-BN. Raman spectroscopy indicates that the AB/nano-BN samples are physical mixtures of AB and h-BN. The release of hydrogen from AB/ nano-BN mixtures as well as the decomposition products was characterized by 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) solid state NMR spectroscopy, TGA/DSC/MS with 15N-labeled AB, and solution 11B NMR spectroscopy. The 11B MAS solid state NMR spectrum shows that diammoniate of diborane (DADB) is present in the mechanically alloyed mixture, which drastically shortens the induction period for hydrogen release from AB. Analysis of the TGA/DSC/MS spectra with 15N-labeled AB shows that all the borazine (BZ) produced in the reaction comes from AB and that increasing nano-BN surface area results in increased amounts of BZ. However, under high temperature, 150 °C, isothermal conditions, the amount of BZ released significantly decreases. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), selected area diffraction (SAD), and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) of the initial and final nano-BN additive provide evidence for crystallinity loss but not significant chemical changes. The higher concentration of BZ observed for lowtemperature dehydrogenation of AB/nano-BN mixtures versus neat AB is attributed to a surface interaction that favors the formation of precursors which ultimately result in BZ. This pathway can be avoided through isothermal heating at temperatures lower than 150 °C. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Using the quantum-mechanical approach combined with the image charge method we calculated the lowest energy levels of the impurities and neutral vacancies with two electrons or holes located in the vicinity of flat surface of different solids. Unexpectedly we obtained that the magnetic triplet state is the ground state of the impurities and neutral vacancies in the vicinity of surface, while the nonmagnetic singlet is the ground state in the bulk, for e.g. He atom, Li, Beions, etc. The energy difference between the lowest triplet and singlet states strongly depends on the electron (hole) effective mass μ, dielectric permittivity of the solid ε2 and the distance from the surface z0. For z0=0 and defect charge |Z|=2 the energy difference is more than several hundreds of Kelvins at μ=(0.5-1)me and ε2=210, more than several tens of Kelvins at μ=(0.1-0.2)me and ε2=510, and not more than several Kelvins at μ<0.1me and ε2>15 (m e is the mass of a free electron). Pair interaction of the identical surface defects (two doubly charged impurities or vacancies with two electrons or holes) reveals the ferromagnetic spin state with the maximal exchange energy at the definite distance between the defects (∼525 nm). We estimated the critical concentration of surface defects and transition temperature of ferromagnetic long-range order appearance in the framework of percolation and mean field theories, and RKKY approach for semiconductors like ZnO. We obtained that the nonmagnetic singlet state is the lowest one for a molecule with two electrons formed by a pair of identical surface impurities (like surface hydrogen), while its next state with deep enough negative energy minimum is the magnetic triplet. The metastable magnetic triplet state appeared for such molecule at the surface indicates the possibility of metastable ortho-states of the hydrogen-like molecules, while they are absent in the bulk of material. The two series of spectral lines are expected due to the coexistence of ortho- and para-states of the molecules at the surface. We hope that obtained results could provide an alternative mechanism of the room temperature ferromagnetism observed in TiO2, HfO2, and In2O3 thin films with contribution of the oxygen vacancies. We expect that both anion and cation vacancies near the flat surface act as magnetic defects because of their triplet ground state and Hunds rule. The theoretical forecasts are waiting for experimental justification allowing for the number of the defects in the vicinity of surface is much larger than in the bulk of as-grown samples. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Metal hydrides are likely candidates for the solid state storage of hydrogen. NaAlH4 is the only complex metal hydride identified so far that combines favorable thermodynamics with a reasonable hydrogen storage capacity (5.5 wt %) when decomposing in two steps to NaH, Al, and H2. The slow kinetics and poor reversibility of the hydrogen desorption can be combatted by the addition of a Ti-based catalyst. In an alternative approach we studied the influence of a reduced NaAlH4 particle size and the presence of a carbon support. We focused on NaAlH4/porous carbon nanocomposites prepared by melt infiltration. The NaAlH4 was confined in the mainly 2-3 nm pores of the carbon, resulting in a lack of long-range order in the NaAlH4 structure. The hydrogen release profile was modified by contact with the carbon; even for ∼10 nm NaAlH4 on a nonporous carbon material the decomposition of NaAlH4 to NaH, Al, and H2 now led to hydrogen release in a single step. This was a kinetic effect, with the temperature at which the hydrogen was released depending on the NaAlH4 feature size. However, confinement in a nanoporous carbon material was essential to not only achieve low H2 release temperatures, but also rehydrogenation at mild conditions (e.g., 24 bar H 2 at 150 °C). Not only had the kinetics of hydrogen sorption improved, but the thermodynamics had also changed. When hydrogenating at conditions at which Na3AlH6 would be expected to be the stable phase (e.g., 40 bar H2 at 160 °C), instead nanoconfined NaAlH4 was formed, indicating a shift of the NaAlH 4↔Na3AlH6 thermodynamic equilibrium in these nanocomposites compared to bulk materials. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  A comprehensive study of the effects of nanometric Ni (n-Ni) additive having a specific surface area (SSA) of 9.5 and 14.5 m2/g on the dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation behavior of mechanically (ball) milled LiAlH4 has been carried out using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and volumetric hydrogen desorption in a Sieverts-type apparatus under 0.1 MPa H2 pressure. The LiAlH 4 + 1, 5 and 10 wt.% n-Ni mixtures were processed by a simple mixing as well as low energy and high energy mechanical (ball) milling in a unique magneto-mill. No decomposition during milling up to 1 h has been observed for LiAlH4 + 5 and 10 wt.% n-Ni. A mixing of LiAlH4 + n-Ni still results in the melting of LiAlH4. In contrast, doping with 5 and 10 wt.% n-Ni combined with high energy ball milling completely eliminates melting of LiAlH4. Volumetric dehydrogenation studies show that throughout the entire temperature range from 100 °C to 250 °C a LiAlH4 + n-Ni nanocomposite system ball milled under high energy mode always desorbs hydrogen in a solid state without any melting in two stages I and II. Stage I is related to the transformation of LiAlH4 into (Li3AlH6 + Al + H2) and Stage II is related to the transformation of Li3AlH6 into (LiH + Al + H 2). The apparent activation energy of Stage I and II equals ∼70 and ∼100 kJ/mol, respectively. This can be compared with the apparent activation energy of ball milled undoped LiAlH4 equal to about 90 kJ/mol for both Stage I and II as reported in Ref. [9]. It is also shown that n-Ni is a very potent catalyst destabilizing a ball milled mixture of LiAlH 4 + 5 wt.% to the extent that it is capable to desorb slowly quite substantial quantities of hydrogen at RT, 40 and 80 °C. The rate of H 2 release during storage at this temperature range can be easily regulated by increasing or decreasing temperature. These virtues make the LiAlH4 + 5 wt.% n-Ni mixture a potential hydrogen storage material for applications where a continuous supply of hydrogen is required for a prolonged service time as, for example, in some chemical processes where the presence of a reducing atmosphere is required. Rehydrogenation attempts of ball milled dehydrogenated LiAlH4 + 5 wt.% n-Ni have been made. The dehydrogenation temperatures were selected in such a manner as to rehydrogenate either starting from the (Li3AlH3 + Al) (dehydrogenation at 120 °C) or from the (LiH + Al) (dehydrogenation at 170 and 250 °C) phase composition. Rehydrogenation temperatures and pressures of H2 were in the range of 55-250 °C and 0.2-10 MPa, respectively. Unfortunately, no successful rehydrogenation has been observed under these conditions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  The following composite hydride systems: NaBH4-MgH2, MgH2-LiAlH4, MgH2-VH0.81 and MgH2-NaAlH4, were synthesized in a wide range of compositions by controlled reactive/mechanical (ball) milling in a magneto-mill.

It is shown that the hydrogen desorption temperature of the composite constituent with the higher desorption temperature in the systems such as NaBH4 + MgH2, MgH2 + VH0.81 and MgH2 + LiAlH4 substantially decreases linearly with increasing volume fraction of the constituent having lower desorption temperature according to the well-known composite rule-of-mixtures (ROM). It is also shown that the ROM behavior can break down due to an ineffective milling of a composite. The composite system MgH2 + NaAlH4 does not obey the ROM behavior. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  This study employed a fast, simple and cost-effective hydriding combustion synthesis (HCS) to prepare nano/submicron Mg based alloys, which are the most promising solid state hydrogen storage materials owing to their high storage capacity (7.6 wt.%) and highest volumetric density. The microstructural and absorption/desorption kinetic properties of the prepared MgH2 samples were characterized and compared with commercially available MgH2 powders. The detailed BET analysis of the HCS prepared samples showed a higher surface area than that of commercial MgH2, which resulted in better absorption/desorption kinetics. The HCS-prepared MgH2 powder absorbed 6.2 wt.% H2 with a rate of 0.31 wt.%/min, whereas it desorbed at a rate of 0.98 wt.%/min.

 Abstract:  On the basis of a previously acquired experience on scaling up issues concerning the use of magnesium hydride as a base material for solid-state hydrogen storage, a small reactor was designed and tested in different operating conditions. It contains about 10 g of catalyzed magnesium hydride powder mixed with 5 wt.% aluminium powder and pressed in the form of cylindrical pellets and the heat flow is managed by means of an oil circulation system. Carbon paper is used to ensure good heat conductivity between the pellets and the inner wall of the reactor and between one pellet and another. A number of hydrogen absorption and desorption cycles at different temperatures and pressures was carried out to compare the behaviour of the small reactor with the laboratory data obtained on small amounts (fractions of grams) of powdered and pelletized samples. Data acquisition for gas flow, pressure and temperature in different positions of the reactor allow a good understanding of internal dynamics. The results in terms of hydrogen absorption/desorption kinetics and of stability to ongoing cycles are stimulating, so that the tested small reactor can be considered as a basic element for further studies and improvements. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Knowledge about the ground-state crystal structure is a prerequisite for the rational understanding of solid-state properties of new materials. To act as an efficient energy carrier, hydrogen should be absorbed and desorbed in materials easily and in high quantities. Owing to the complexity in structural arrangements and difficulties involved in establishing hydrogen positions by x-ray diffraction methods, the structural information of hydrides are very limited compared to other classes of materials (like oxides, intermetallics, etc.). This can be overcome by conducting computational simulations combined with selected experimental study which can save environment, money, and man power. The predicting capability of first-principles density functional theory (DFT) is already well recognized and in many cases structural and thermodynamic properties of single/multi component system are predicted. This review will focus on possible new classes of materials those have high hydrogen content, demonstrate the ability of DFT to predict crystal structure, and search for potential meta-stable phases. Stabilization of such meta-stable phases is also discussed. © 2009 by the authors.

 Abstract:  In this work vibrational properties of alkaline-metal borohydrides and of the corresponding tetrafluorborates are studied by comparing DFT harmonic vibrational IR and Raman spectra of the crystals with the experimental ones, obtained by infrared attenuated total reflection and Raman techniques. The computed internal bending frequencies of the [BX4]- anions are found to be in good agreement with the experiment, and the computed stretching frequencies of tetrafluorborates are slightly underestimated. As expected, due to the neglecting of anharmonicity in the DFT spectra, the computed stretching frequencies of borohydrides are overestimated. The peak assignment of the experimental spectra is carried out in terms of factor group theory. For borohydrides, it is mostly in agreement with previously published data but for a peak observed at ca. 1400 cm-1. The peak assignment for KBF4 and LiBF4 was carried out for the first time in terms of factor group theory.

 Abstract:  Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit extraordinary mechanical, electronic and thermal properties, because of which they have been used in several applications like mechanical reinforcement of polymers, electrocatalysis, sensors, electronics, batteries, etc. Nafion is a sulfonated fluoropolymer that has become standard material in fuel cell applications for its excellent proton conducting property, and for its thermal and mechanical stability.Recently, Nafion/CNTs composites with CNT amounts less than the percolation threshold have been used to increase the mechanical stability and decrease methanol permeation of nafion, with very little effect on proton conductivity and avoiding short circuit risks. Above the percolation threshold, such membranes show the potentialities to allow a separate proton/electron conduction paths within the membrane. This aspect opens new ways for applications in selective membranes for artificial innovative devices capable of using sunlight to produce hydrogen from water splitting.Nafion + multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) nanocomposite films with varying amounts of filler were fabricated and their proton/electron transport behaviors were characterized. Samples were prepared by recasting Nafion with MWCNTs and conditions were optimized to obtain freestanding films of thickness around 100μm. After ultrasonication, we observed a uniform dispersion of the carbon fillers inside the matrix, with a good affinity between the two materials without the need of CNT surface functionalization.

The structure of Y(BH 4) 3·4NH 3, determined by high resolution powder X-ray diffraction, crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pc2 1n with lattice parameters a = 7.1151(1) Å, b = 11.4192(2) Å, c = 12.2710(2) Å and V = 997.02(2) Å 3, in which the dihydrogen bonds with distances in the range of 2.043 to 2.349 Å occurred between the NH 3 and BH 4 - units contribute to the hydrogen liberation via the combination reaction of N-H⋯H-B. Thermal gravimetric analysis combined with mass spectrometer results revealed that the decomposition of Y(BH 4) 3·4NH 3 consists of three steps with peaks at 86 °C, 179 °C and 279 °C, respectively, in which the first and second steps mainly release hydrogen accompanied by a fair amount of ammonia emission, while the third one accounts for a pure hydrogen release. Isothermal dehydrogenation results revealed that over 8.7 wt.% hydrogen was released for Y(BH 4) 3·4NH 3 at 200 °C, which are improved significantly in terms of both capacity and kinetics comparing to Y(BH 4) 3, in which the hydrogen capacity is only 3.2 wt.% at the same temperature. The favorable dehydrogenation properties presented by the Y(BH 4) 3·4NH 3, i.e., lower dehydrogenation temperature and higher nominal hydrogen contents than that of Y(BH 4) 3, enable it to be a promising candidate for hydrogen storage.

 Abstract:  The materials under study are pillared solids T[Ni(CN)4]·xpyz with one and two (x=1,2) pyrazine (pyz) molecules and where T=Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Cd. Stimulated by their structural features and potential role as prototype of porous solids for hydrogen storage, the structural stability under cryogenic conditions for this series of pillared solids was studied. At low temperature, in the 100-200 K range, the occurrence of a reversible structural transformation was found. For T=Mn, Co, Zn, Cd, with x=2, the structural transformation was observed to occur around 185 K, and the low temperature phase crystallizes with a monoclinic unit cell (space group Pc). This structure change results from certain charge redistribution on cooling within the involved ligands. For T=Ni with x=1, both the low and high temperature phases crystallize with unit cells of tetragonal symmetry, within the same space group but with a different unit cell volume. In this case the structure change is observed around 120 K. Above that temperature the rotational states for the pyrazine molecule are thermally excited and all the pyrazine molecules in the structure become equivalent. Under this condition the material structure is described using a smaller structural unit.

 Abstract:  In this work, we investigate the structural, dynamic and thermodynamic properties of NaMgH3, devoted for hydrogen storage. Density functional theory using pseudopotential methods and generalized gradient approximation has been used. A good agreement between the calculated structural parameters and the experimental data was found. A linear-response approach for the density functional theory is used in order to derive the Born effective charge tensors, the dielectric permittivity tensors, the phonon frequencies at the center of the Brillouin zone, the phonon-dispersion curves and the corresponding density of states for NaMgH3 material. The obtained phonon frequencies at the zone center (Γ point) for the Raman-active and infrared-active modes are analyzed.

 Abstract:  In Part 1, the promising hydrogen storage properties of the combined systems of Li3AlH6/LiBH4 and Al/LiBH 4, exhibiting the favorable formation of AlB2 during dehydrogenation, were presented based on TGA and XRD analyses. The present Part 2 describes the characterization of the intermediate and final products of the dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation of the above systems by multinuclear solid-state NMR characterization. This work has also verified that the presence of Al resulted in the re-formation of LiBH4 occurring at a much lower temperature and H2 pressure, under which conditions the dehydrogenation product from LiBH4 alone does not show any degree of rehydrogenation. NMR studies mainly identified various reaction intermediates for LiBH4 dehydrogenation/rehydrogenation reactions. Unlike the XRD studies, the AlB2 formation, in particular, could not be unambiguously confirmed by NMR. 27Al NMR showed that aluminum was mainly involved in various Li - Al alloy formations. The catalytic role of Al in the LiBH4 hydrogen storage reactivity could be achieved by a reversible cycle of the Al + LiH ? LiAl + 1/2H2 reaction. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  The group II alkaline-earth metal borohydrides, Mg(BH4) 2 and Ca(BH4)2 are among the most promising materials for light-weight, high-capacity hydrogen storage. Five years ago, little were known about the potential of these materials for reversible hydrogen storage, except for their high hydrogen content of 14.9 wt% and 11.6 wt% respectively. Theory predicted nearly ideal thermodynamics, but finding competing decomposition pathways with formation of very stable phases which limits cycle life. Solid-state synthesis routes have been developed and crystal structures and decomposition products have been identified as well as methods to improve hydrogen sorption performance including catalysis and nanoscience.

 Abstract:  We have explored metal halide doping in metal borohydrides in order to modify hydrogen desorption/absorption properties of such high-capacity solid-state hydrogen storage materials. The specific application here is 10 mol% addition of CaX2 (X = F, Cl) to Ca(BH4)2. The materials are analyzed using in-situ X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry, and IR spectroscopy, and the experimental results are compared against theoretical predictions from first-principles. Interestingly, in a fully hydrogenated state, CaCl2 dissolves into Ca(BH4)2 whereas CaF2 exists as a separate phase. During the course of dehydrogenation, CaH2-CaF2 solid solution, CaHCl, and a new Ca-H-Cl compound are observed. In-situ X-ray diffraction study reveals that CaX2 interacts with Ca(BH 4)2 in the early stage of decomposition, which could facilitate a direct decomposition of Ca(BH4)2 into CaH2 and CaB6 without forming intermediate phases such as CaB2Hx which seem to be thermodynamically in close competition with the formation of CaH2 and CaB6. Our first-principles calculation estimates that the decrease in the decomposition temperature due to the CaH2-CaX2 interaction would be less than 10 °C, and therefore the major contribution of CaX2 is to change the dehydrogenation pathway rather than the overall thermodynamics. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  The present work deals with two essential degradation mechanisms of zirconium alloys: Hydrogen behavior and microstructural transformations due to neutron irradiation. The studies were carried out by using samples taken from Zircaloy-4 components, which remained for 14 years in the Atucha I pressurized heavy water reactor, accumulating neutron fluences of up to 1022 neutrons/cm2. A hydrogen/deuterium solubility increase was observed in both dissolution and precipitation processes. With the aim to follow this evolution with radiation damage recovery, the irradiated samples were annealed for different periods at 350 and 400°C in a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). These temperatures were chosen to reproduce those reached by spent fuels in the early stages of the dry storage (DS). Between intervals, the terminal solid solubility temperatures in dissolution (TTSSd) and in precipitation (TTSSp) were determined. They were also determined after additional annealing at 500 and 600°C, trying to simulate long periods at DS. The hydride morphology and the metallurgical state of the Zr(Fe,Cr) 2 second-phase particles (SPPs) were followed between annealing by optical microscopy, analytical electron microscopy, synchrotron light X-ray diffraction (SXRD), and DSC. As a brief summary, we found from the first to the last run of the annealing sequence an increase of 55°C in TTSSd and 40°C in TTSSp on average. The optical and transmission electron microscopies (TEM) indicate that in the material in the irradiated condition, exists a hydride size distribution of four orders of magnitude, from 10 nm to 100 μm, but biased to sizes smaller than 5 μm. A complete amorphisation of the SPPs was observed in high fluence samples by TEM and SXRD. Similar TEM observations made in irradiated samples annealed above 400°C show a reprecipitation process of nano-SPPs forming clusters. The re-precipitation is affected by kinetics: The SPPs crystallization temperature, Tc, rises from 450 to 500°C as the heating rate increases from 5 to 20°C/min. The measured heat of crystallization was 27.3±2.1 kJ/mol (Fe+Cr). Copyright © 2011 by ASTM International.

H 2pzdc is singly deprotonated in both complexes and the coordination mode of Hpzdc ligand in 1 has been first reported in this presentation. The complex 1, which has a 3D framework structure, was formed with double μ-chloride and μ3-Hpzdc bridges. In 1, water molecules occupy in the 1D channel as guest molecules. Furthermore, unprecedented 1D hybrid water-chloride anionic [(H2O)8Cl2]n cluster has been structurally identified. In the complex 2, the Cd(II) atom is seven-coordinated by two hydrogen pyrazine-2,3-dicarboxylate, two chloride and one aqua ligands in a distorted monocapped octahedral coordination geometry. The Cd(II) atoms are bridged by the bis(bidentate) Hpzdc ligands, forming 1D polymer chain. The adjacent 1D chains are linked each other through the double chloride bridges to form 2D layer.

 Abstract:  The solidification microstructures of three nine-element Zr-Ni-based AB2 type C14/C15 Laves hydrogen storage alloys are determined. The selected compositions represent a class of alloys being examined for usage as an MH electrode in nickel metal-hydride batteries that often have their best properties in the cast state. Solidification is accomplished by dendritic growth of hexagonal C14 Laves phase, peritectic solidification of cubic C15 Laves phase, and formation of cubic B2 phase in the interdendritic regions. The B2 phase decomposes in the solid state into a complex multivariate platelike structure containing Zr-Ni-rich intermetallics. The observed sequence C14/C15 upon solidification agrees with predictions using effective compositions and thermodynamic assessments of the ternary systems, Ni-Cr-Zr and Cr-Ti-Zr.

 Abstract:  Tuning the hydrogen storage properties of complex metal hydrides is of vast interest. Here, we investigate the hydrogen release and uptake pathways for a reactive hydride composite, LiBH4-NaAlH4 utilizing in situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction experiments. Sodium alanate transforms to sodium borohydride via a metathesis reaction during ball milling or by heating at T∼95 °C. NaBH4 decomposes at ∼340 °C in dynamic vacuum, apparently directly to solid amorphous boron and hydrogen and sodium gas and the latter two elements are lost from the sample. Under other conditions, T=400 °C and p(H2)=∼1 bar, NaBH4 only partly decomposes to B and NaH. On the other hand, formation of LiAl is facilitated by dynamic vacuum conditions, which gives access to the full hydrogen contents in the LiBH4-NaAlH4 system. Formation of AlB2 is observed (T∼450 °C) and other phases, possibly AlBx or Al1-xLixB2, were observed for the more Li-rich samples. This may open new routes to the stabilization of boron in the solid state in the dehydrogenated state, which is a challenging and important issue for hydrogen storage systems based on borohydrides. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

 Abstract:  Polymer nanocomposites of poly (4,4'-diphenylether-5,5'-bibenzimidazole) (OPBI) were prepared with two structurally different organoclays, namely, montmorillonite (OMMT) and kaolinite (OKao), to evaluate the effect of clay structures on the nanocomposites morphology, structure, and the properties. Solid State 13C cross-polarization magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, small-angle X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy studies suggested the formation of exfoliated structure for OPBI/OMMT, whereas and intercalated structure was obtained for OPBI/OKao. Both the nanocomposites displayed significant enhancement in the thermal stabilities compared to the pristine OPBI, and the higher thermal stability of OPBI/OMMT than that of OPBI/OKao was attributed to the higher degree of dispersion of the nanoclay into the OPBI matrix owing to the exfoliated structure of the former. Both the nanocomposites membranes exhibited large mechanical reinforcement by the clays and the superior mechanical property was obtained in the rubbery state compared to the glassy state. The storage moduli (E') for the OPBI/OKao membranes were found to be higher than that of OPBI/OMMT and recognized to the different dispersion patterns of both the organoclays along the polymer matrixes. The dispersed clay particles in the OPBI matrix shielded the polymer chains from the attack of oxidative radicals and resulted in huge enhancement of oxidative stability of the nanocomposites membranes compared to the pure OPBI membrane. The nanocomposites membranes have significantly higher phosphoric acid (PA) loading compared to the pure OPBI membrane which resulted higher proton conductivities of the formers. A continuous ""forming-breaking-forming"" process of weak hydrogen bonds of OPBI and the organoclays with PA was found to be the driving force for nearly a one order increase in proton conductivities for nanocomposite membranes. The low activation energy (Ea), comparable with the Ea of free PA, obtained from the temperature dependent proton conductivities suggested a faster proton conduction process. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Due to its high hydrogen content and its favourable overall thermodynamics magnesium tetrahydroborate has been considered interesting for hydrogen storage applications. In this work we show that unsolvated amorphous magnesium tetrahydroborate can be obtained by reactive ball milling of commercial MgB 2 under 100 bar hydrogen atmosphere. The material was characterized by solid-state NMR which showed the characteristic features of Mg(BH 4)2, together with those of higher borohydride species. High pressure DSC and TPD-MS showed thermal behaviour similar to that of Mg(BH4)2 but with broadened signals. In situ synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction confirmed the amorphous state of the material and showed the typical crystalline decomposition products of Mg(BH4) 2 at elevated temperatures. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  The phase abundances of 16 alloys with various contents of Sn, Co, Al, and Fe additives were studied by X-ray diffraction analysis. Due to relative small percentages, the relative abundances of these minor phases were obtained through smoothing, curve fitting, and area integration and correlated qualitatively to the amount of additives in the alloys. In the Laves phases, Sn, Co, and Fe with more outer-shell electrons than that of the host alloy promote C15 phase. Al, with less outer-shell electrons, on the other hand, promotes C14 phase. In the AB phases, Sn promotes the formation of ZrNi phase and suppresses the formation of TiNi phase. In the competition between Zr7Ni10 and Zr9Ni11 (both are the products from a solid-state transformation), Sn promotes Zr7Ni10 while both Fe and Al promote Zr9Ni11. The phase abundances were further correlated to the gas phase and electrochemical properties of the alloys. C14, Zr9Ni11, and TiNi phases were found to increase both the gas phase and electrochemical storage capacities, lower the hydrogen equilibrium pressure, decrease the half-cell high-rate dischargeability, improve both charge retention and cycle life, and slightly decrease the capacity recovery after storing at 45 °C for 60 days. C15, ZrNi, and Zr7Ni 10 phases work in the opposite manner. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  Ti-based BCC solid solutions are promising hydrogen storage applications. Unfortunately, the application of these alloys in large scale is hindered by the high cost of vanadium. The solution of this problem may be to replace vanadium by ferro-vanadium (FeV). Here, we report our recent investigation of compositions TiV1-xMn1+x and Ti(FeV)1-xMn 1+x where x = -0.2, -0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.2. Each composition was synthesized by arc melting. No subsequent heat treatment was performed. The alloys' crystal structure in as-cast state and after hydrogenation was inspected by X-ray powder diffraction. We found that replacement of vanadium by ferrovanadium had the positive effect of destabilization of the hydride which makes it more useful for practical applications. Also even if the total hydrogen capacity was reduced, the reversible capacity could be improved. We found that replacement of vanadium by ferrovanadium drastically change the crystal structure of hydrogenated compounds. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

 Abstract:  Mechanochemical transformations of lithium and sodium amides with calcium hydride have been investigated using gas volumetric analysis, X-ray powder diffraction, and residual gas analysis. The overall mechanochemical transformations are equimolar, and they proceed as the following solid state reaction: MNH2 + CaH2 → CaNH + MH + H2, where M = Li or Na. The transformation kinetics of the lithium containing system is markedly faster compared to the system with sodium. The difference in the rates of solid state transformations, and therefore, in hydrogen release kinetics can be explained by difference in mobility of lithium and sodium atoms. Total energies and enthalpies of formation for different reaction products during the dehydrogenation of CaH2-MNH2 mixtures were calculated using density functional theory. Compared to thermochemical transformations, which proceed in accordance with thermodynamic equilibrium, reactions induced by mechanical energy drive the MNH2-CaH2 systems to nonequilibrium configurations with different final products. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  The lattice constants a and c of the as cast hexagonal (C14) Laves phase TiCr1.78-xMnx (x = 0, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8) have been measured by X-ray diffraction at room temperature as a function of the Mn content. It has been found that a decreases with increasing x while c remains almost unchanged. Being this alloy interesting as material for solid state hydrogen storage, pressure-composition isotherms have been traced on desorption mode for the H2 gas pressure and temperature varying from 10 to 0.01 MPa and from 209 to 307 K, respectively. From the temperature dependence of the plateau pressure the molar quantities Δ over(H, ̄)H and Δ over(S, ̄)H associated with the hydride decomposition have been determined as a function of the Mn content. With increasing x, both Δ over(H, ̄)H and Δ over(S, ̄)H progressively decrease, and the desorption pressure initially decreases (for x ≤ 0.4) then slightly increases.

 Abstract:  In recent years there has been considerable interest in sodium alanate as a prototypical complex hydride for solid-state hydrogen storage. Much effort has gone into understanding the rate-limiting processes in its hydrogen release and absorption reactions. The diffusion of metal species has been suggested as a possible kinetic bottleneck in Ti-doped materials. In this paper, we outline an approach for calculating the diffusivity of defects in complicated lattices using a combination of first-principles density-functional theory calculations and stochastic kinetic Monte Carlo methods. We apply this methodology to the diffusion of metal defects in NaAlH4 and Na3AlH 6 that have been predicted to exist in large concentrations. We find that of the metal defects that exist in the largest concentrations, a neutral AlH3 vacancy is the most mobile in NaAlH4 (ΔH mig = 0.34 eV, D0 = 1.30 × 10-2 cm 2/s, and DT=400K = 7.55 × 10-7 cm 2/s) and that a negatively charged Na vacancy is the most mobile in Na3AlH6 (ΔHmig = 0.33 eV, D0 = 6.67 × 10-3 cm2/s, and DT=400K = 4.96 × 10-7 cm2/s). At T = 400 K, the calculated diffusion rates are an order of magnitude lower for charged AlH4 vacancies in NaAlH4 (ΔH = 0.44 eV, D0 = 1.41 × 10-2 cm2/s, and DT=400K = 3.92 × 10 -8 cm2/s) and charged Na vacancies in NaAlH4 (ΔH = 0.43 eV, D0 = 2.96 × 10-3 cm 2/s, and DT=400K = 1.19 × 10-8 cm 2/s).

 Abstract:  The results of the studies on the dehydrogenation behavior of the ball milled LiAlH4 catalyzed with 5 wt.% of manganese chloride (MnCl 2) are reported. During ball milling for 15 min the LiAlH4 + 5 wt.% MnCl2 nanocomposite releases a miniscule amount of ∼0.25 wt.% H2. However, no products of the possible reaction between LiAlH4 and MnCl2 (e.g. LiCl) are observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). In a DSC test most of LiAlH4 decomposes exothermically to Li3AlH6 in a solid state while a small fraction of retained LiAlH4 melts and decomposes in a liquid state. During dehydrogenation at 100 °C under 0.1 MPa H2 the ball milled LiAlH4 + 5 wt.% MnCl2 nanocomposite is able to desorb ∼4.6 wt.% H2 within ∼30,000 s in a solid state but only in Stage I (reaction: LiAlH4 (solid) → 1/3Li3AlH 6 + 2/3Al + H2). The apparent activation energy of dehydrogenation for this solid state reaction is equal to ∼80 kJ/mol as compared to ∼70 kJ/mol obtained for LiAlH4+5 wt.% n-Ni [7]. However, during decomposition at 100 °C a chemical reaction occurs between LiAlH4 and MnCl2 producing LiCl and most likely an amorphous Mn metal catalyzing the reaction in Stage I. The ball milled LiAlH4+5 wt.% MnCl2 nanocomposite is capable of desorbing substantial quantities of H2 during long term storage at room temperature (RT; ∼21 °C), 40 and 80 °C. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Cryogenic slush fluids such as slush hydrogen and slush nitrogen are two-phase, single-component fluids containing solid particles in a liquid. Since their density and refrigerant capacity are greater than those of liquid-state fluid alone, there are high expectations for the use of slush fluids in various applications such as clean-energy fuels, spacecraft fuels for improved efficiency in transportation and storage, and as refrigerants for high-temperature superconducting equipment. Experimental tests were performed using slush nitrogen to obtain the flow and heat-transfer characteristics in two different types of horizontal circular pipes with inner diameters of 10 and 15 mm. One of the primary objectives for the study was to investigate the effect of pipe diameter on the pressure-drop reduction and heat-transfer deterioration of slush nitrogen according to changes in the pipe flow velocity, solid fraction and heat flux. In the case of an inner diameter of 15 mm, pressure drop was reduced and heat-transfer characteristics deteriorated when the pipe flow velocity was higher than 3.6 m/s. On the other hand, in the case of an inner diameter of 10 mm, pressure drop was reduced and heat-transfer characteristics deteriorated when the pipe flow velocity was higher than 2.0 m/s. From these results, it can be seen that a larger pipe diameter produces a higher onset velocity for reducing pressure drop and deteriorating heat-transfer characteristics. Furthermore, based on observations using a high-speed video camera, it was confirmed that pressure drop was reduced and heat-transfer characteristics deteriorated when the solid particles migrated to the center of the pipe and the flow pattern of the solid particles inside the pipe was pseudo-homogeneous. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

 Abstract:  The LiBH4 + MgH2 system has great potential in reversible hydrogen storage for fuel cell vehicles. However, it has always been dehydrogenated and rehydrogenated in the liquid state until recently. The solid-state hydriding and dehydriding are necessary in order to achieve hydrogen uptake and release near ambient temperature. In this study, the solid-state hydriding mechanism of 2LiH + MgB2 mixtures has been investigated. It is found that the solid-state hydriding proceeds in two elementary steps. The first step is the ion exchange between the Mg2+ and Li+ ions in the MgB2 crystal to form an intermediate compound (Mg 1-xLi2x)B2. The second step is the continuous ion exchange and simultaneous hydrogenation of (Mg1-xLi 2x)B2 to form LiBH4 and MgH2. This finding is consistent with the observed diffusion-controlled hydriding kinetics. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Metal ammine complexes (MACs) were recently regarded as one of promising materials for reversible hydrogen storage due to their high hydrogen content. In this work, a first attempt is conducted to elucidate the hydrogen storage reversibility by combining Mg(NH3)6Cl2 with LiH. It is found that hydrogen is gradually evolved from the combined system during ball milling. After 24 h of milling, approximate 3.5 mass% of hydrogen, equivalent to 6 mol Of H2 molecules, is released from the Mg(NH3)6Cl2-18LiH mixture. Additional 3.4mass% of hydrogen is further desorbed from the combined system milled for 24 h with a two-step reaction in heating process. Totally ∼12 mol of H2 molecules are librated from the Mg(NH3)6Cl2-18LiH mixture along with the formation and consumption of Mg(NH2)2 and LiNH2 in the ball milling and subsequent heating process. The resultant products consist of Li2Mg(NH)2, Li 2NH, LiH and LiCl after dehydrogenation at 310°C.

 Abstract:  Three different fatty acid alkyl esters, lauric acid methyl ester (LAME), myristic acid methyl ester (MAME), and palmitic acid methyl ester (PAME), were used to encapsulate solid-liquid phase change materials (PCMs) by a simple melt-infiltration method. The effects of the fatty acids on the heat storage properties of the PCMs were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. The results showed that the saturated fatty acids could enhance the phase change temperatures and latent heat of the encapsulated PCMs. The lower the carbon number of the saturated fatty acids used for encapsulation, the better the heat storage performance of the encapsulated PCMs. The leakage issue in the encapsulated PCMs was not evident. These findings indicated that the fatty acid alkyl esters could be potential ideal thermal energy storage materials. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  Pyrochlore-type yttrium titanate (Y2Ti2O7) nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by a simple soft-chemistry technique viz. citric acid sol-gel method (CAM). The preparation process was monitored by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis and Fourier transform-infrared experiments and the microstructures and average size of as-prepared products were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy images. It was found that compared with traditional solid state reaction (SSR), Y 2Ti2O7 nanopowders were synthesized at a relatively low temperature (750°C) for shortened reaction time. Detailed analysis showed that the as-prepared Y2Ti2O7 with good dispersibility and narrow size distribution were quasi-spherical; the average size was about 20-30 nm, also, the obtained products had higher BET surface area (50 m2/g). These properties are very helpful for a photocatalyst to achieve excellent activity and may result in better behaviour in hydrogen storage. © Indian Academy of Sciences.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen is expected to play an important role as an energy carrier in a future, more sustainable society. However, its compact, efficient, and safe storage is an unresolved issue. One of the main options is solid-state storage in hydrides. Unfortunately, no binary metal hydride satisfies all requirements regarding storage density and hydrogen release and uptake. Increasingly complex hydride systems are investigated, but high thermodynamic stabilities as well as slow kinetics and poor reversibility are important barriers for practical application. Nanostructuring by ball-milling is an established method to reduce crystallite sizes and increase reaction rates. Since five years attention has also turned to alternative preparation techniques that enable particle sizes below 10 nanometers and are often used in conjunction with porous supports or scaffolds. In this Review we discuss the large impact of nanosizing and -confinement on the hydrogen sorption properties of metal hydrides. We illustrate possible preparation strategies, provide insight into the reasons for changes in kinetics, reversibility and thermodynamics, and highlight important progress in this field. All in all we provide the reader with a clear view of how nanosizing and -confinement can beneficially affect the hydrogen sorption properties of the most prominent materials that are currently considered for solid-state hydrogen storage. Light metal hydrides are an important option for compact, safe, and efficient on-board hydrogen storage. However, slow kinetics, poor reversibility, and low equilibrium pressures hamper their practical application. We review the impact of nanosizing and -confinement; recent strategies with a large impact on the hydrogen sorption properties of relevant light metal hydrides.

 Abstract:  The composite behaviour of sodium borohydride - magnesium hydride mixtures was investigated. Mutual influence of both hydrides on their decomposition process was studied. The (NaBH 4+MgH 2) composite hydride system was synthesized in a wide range of compositions by controlled mechanical (ball) milling in a magneto-mill. In effect, nanocomposites having nanometric grain sizes of the constituent phases residing within micrometric-sized particles were produced. The dehydrogenation process of obtained composites was investigated by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) method. It is shown that the hydrogen desorption temperature of the composite constituent with the higher desorption temperature in the (NaBH 4+MgH 2) system substantially decreases linearly with increasing volume fraction of the constituent having lower desorption temperature which is similar behavior to well-known composite Rule-of-Mixtures (ROM) for structural composites. It is also shown that in the (NaBH 4+MgH 2) composite the constituents such as MgH 2 and NaBH 4 decompose separately and destabilization of the composite constituent with a higher desorption temperature is unrelated to the formation of MgB 2 intermetallic phase. Therefore, the improved dehydrogenation properties for NaBH 4 is likely due to the presence of nanostructured metallic Mg which acts as a catalyst. It is also shown that, most likely, the NaBH 4 constituent act as a catalyst for the accelerated decomposition of MgH 2.

 Abstract:  Chemistry with its key targets of providing materials and processes for conversion of matter is at the center stage of the energy challenge. Most energy conversion systems work on (bio)chemical energy carriers and require for their use suitable process and material solutions. The enormous scale of their application demands optimization beyond the incremental improvement of empirical discoveries. Knowledge-based systematic approaches are mandatory to arrive at scalable and sustainable solutions. Chemistry for energy, ""ENERCHEM"" contributes in many ways already today to the use of fossil energy carriers. Optimization of these processes exemplified by catalysis for fuels and chemicals production or by solid-state lightning can contribute in the near future substantially to the dual challenge of energy use and climate protection being in fact two sides of the same challenge. The paper focuses on the even greater role that ENERCHEM will have to play in the era of renewable energy systems where the storage of solar energy in chemical carries and batteries is a key requirement. A multidisciplinary and diversified approach is suggested to arrive at a stable and sustainable system of energy conversion processes. The timescales for transformation of the present energy scenario will be decades and the resources will be of global economic dimensions. ENERCHEM will have to provide the reliable basis for such technologies based on deep functional understanding. © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

 Abstract:  Chemical hydrides are compounds that can potentially uptake and release hydrogen without the use of hydrogen gas. Nanostructure silicon may have great potential as a chemical hydride. The surface can be capped by hydride and dihydride, and hydrogen can be thermally desorbed from the surface. We have prepared large-scale (1 -2 g) samples of hydrogen-capped silicon nanoparticles with average diameters of 60,10,5, and 4 nm via a low-temperature chemical method to explore the release of hydrogen from the surface as a function of size. The 60- and 10-nm-diameter particles have only hydrogen on the surface. The 60-nm-diameter particles are crystalline, and the 10-nm-diameter particles are amorphous according to powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The 5- and 4-nm-diameter particles have both hydrogen and solvent capped on the surface. The 4-nm-diameter particles are amorphous and the 5-nm-diameter particles are crystalline by powder XRD. Weight percentages of ∼3.5% at 350 °C are observed for the 10-nm-diameter particles. The largest weight loss is observed for the amorphous 4-nm-diameter particles, which show a weight loss of ∼4.5%, which is attributed primarily to hydrogen. The products have been investigated by powder XRD, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), solid-state magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis, thermogravimetry/differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC), and thermogravimetry/mass spectroscopy (TG/MS). © 2009 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Cryogenic slush fluids, such as slush hydrogen and slush nitrogen, are two-phase single-component fluids containing solid particles in a liquid. Their density and refrigerant capacity are greater than those of a liquid-state fluid alone. Owing to these advantages, there are high expectations for use of slush fluids in various applications such as a clean-energy fuel, fuel for space-planes to improve the efficiency of transportation and storage, and as a refrigerant for high-temperature superconducting power machines. Experimental tests were performed with slush nitrogen to obtain the frictional pressure drop flowing in a horizontal pipe with an inner diameter of 15 mm and a length of 400 mm. The primary objective of the study was to investigate the pressure drop reduction phenomenon according to changes in velocity and solid fraction. The pressure drop correlation between the friction factor and the Reynolds number was obtained, and an empirical correlation between them was derived. The flow pattern for slush nitrogen inside a pipe and the behavior of solid particles were observed using a high-speed video camera and the PIV method. From the experimental results, the pressure drop reduction phenomenon emerged clearly when the flow velocity was higher than 3.6 m/s and the flow pattern of solid particles inside the pipe was pseudo-homogeneous. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

 Abstract:  Anodes for Li-ion batteries are primarily carbon-based due to their low cost and long cycle life. However, improvements to the Li capacity of carbon anodes, LiC6 in particular, are necessary to obtain a larger energy density. State-of-the-art light-metal hydrides for hydrogen storage applications often contain Li and involve reactions requiring Li transport, and light-metal ionic hydrides are candidates for novel conversion materials. Given a set of known solid-state and gas-phase reactants, we have determined the phase diagram in the Li-Mg-B-N-H system in the grand canonical ensemble, as a function of lithium chemical potential. We present computational results for several new conversion reactions with capacities between 2400 and 4000 mAh g-1 that are thermodynamically favorable and that do not involve gas evolution. We provide experimental evidence for the reaction pathway on delithiation for the compound Li4BN3H10.

 Abstract:  Metal hydrides are formed when certain metals or alloys are exposed to hydrogen at favorable temperatures and pressures. In order to sustain the sorption of hydrogen during this exothermic process, the generated heat has to be removed effectively. Release of hydrogen is an endothermic process needing supply of heat to the metal hydride matrix. Depending on the application, the heat transfer medium can be either a liquid or a gas. Reduction of the total weight of hydrogen storage devices is essential toward utilization of hydrogen for mobile and portable applications. While a variety of new storage materials with desirable sorption characteristics are being suggested, optimal thermal design of the storage device remains a major challenge. Lack of thermodynamic, transport, and thermophysical property data of the material particles and of the bed is another drawback which needs to be addressed. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

 Abstract:  Magnesium is a promising material for solid state hydrogen storage, since it has low cost and its hydride can store reversibly up to 7.6 wt.% of hydrogen. Fast H-sorption kinetics at around 300 °C can be achieved after processing Mg-based mixtures by high energy ball milling (HEBM), which produces nanostructured composite powders. Severe plastic deformation (SPD) processing techniques are being explored as an alternative to HEBM in order to obtain more air-resistant materials and to reduce the time and energy required for processing. In this paper, MgH2 and MgH2-Fe mixtures were severely mechanically processed by extensive cold forging (CF) and cold rolling (CR). A very significant grain refinement (up to 10 nm) was achieved, which is comparable to the values typically obtained after processing by HEBM. Enhanced H-sorption properties were observed for these mechanically processed MgH 2-based nanocomposites in comparison with commercial magnesium hydride. The obtained compacts after CR and CF presents a much lower specific surface area than the ball-milled powders and therefore show higher air-resistance. These results are promising from the point of view of applications since it reveals the potential of the use of low cost mechanical processing routes to produce Mg-based nanomaterials for hydrogen storage. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen storage in advanced solid state materials has been an intense area of research due to many drawbacks in conventional high pressure or cryogenic liquid hydrogen storage methods. A practical hydrogen storing material is required to have high storage capacity and fast dehydrogenation kinetics. Among many solid state materials for hydrogen storage, magnesium hydride (MgH 2) combines a hydrogen capacity of 7.6 wt % with the benefit of the low cost of production and abundance. The main difficulties for implementing MgH2 are slow absorption/desorption kinetics and high reactivity towards air and oxygen, which are also common issues in most lightweight metal hydrides. Previously, improvements in hydrogen storage and release properties have been reported by using nanostructured magnesium that can be obtained through various fabrication methods including ball-milling, mechanical alloying, and vapor transport. In this study, we investigate the hydrogen absorption and desorption properties of magnesium ""nanotrees"" fabricated by glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique, and also conventional Mg thin films deposited at normal incidence. Mg nanotrees are about 15 μm long, 10 μm wide, and incorporate ""nanoleaves"" of about 20 nm in thickness and 1,2 μm in lateral width. A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) gas absorption/desorption measurement system has been used for our hydrogen storage studies. Nanostructured and thin film Mg have been deposited directly on the surface of the gold coated unpolished quartz crystal samples. QCM hydrogen storage experiments have been performed at temperatures ranging between 100-300 °C, and at H2 pressures of 10 and 30 bars. Our QCM measurements revealed that Mg nanotrees can absorb hydrogen at lower temperatures and also at a faster rate compared to Mg thin film. In addition, Mg nanotrees can reach hydrogen storage values of about 4.80 wt% at 100 °C, and up to about 6.71 wt% (which is close to the theoretical maximum storage value of Mg) at temperatures lower than 150 °C. The significant enhancement in hydrogen absorption properties of our Mg nanotrees is believed to originate from novel physical properties of their nanoleaves. These nanoleaves are very thin (∼20 nm) and both surfaces are exposed to hydrogen enhancing the diffusion rate of hydrogen together with a decreased diffusion length. Based on X-ray diffraction measurements, individual nanoleaves have non-close-packed crystal planes that can further enhance the hydrogen absorption kinetics. In addition, our nanostructured Mg have been observed to quite resistant to surface oxidation, which is believed to due to the single crystal property of the Mg nanoleaves, which further improves the absorption kinetics of hydrogen. © 2010 Materials Research Society.

 Abstract:  Amine boranes are a class of hydrogen storage materials which release significant yields of hydrogen gas upon heating to temperatures relevant for automotive applications. The thermodynamic stability of this class of amine boranes is correlated with the extensive dihydrogen bonding between hydrides bound to boron and amine protons. Further, the hydrogen evolution follows a bimolecular pathway via the di-hydrogen bonding network. The thermal decomposition of t-butylamine borane (tBuAB), (CH3) 3CNH2BH3, has been studied in order to understand the reaction pathway of hydrogen sorption and the impact of the t-butyl substitution dehydrogenation thermodynamics. 1H, 11B, and 13C solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has revealed that heating initiates two separate reaction pathways: isomerization and hydrocarbon abstraction resulting in varying yields of isobutane and hydrogen. It is also possible that tBuAB dissociates about the N-B bond giving rise to borane stretching modes in the gas FTIR. Trapped t-butylamine (tBuA) which slowly diffuses from the tBuAB solid in 13C NMR studies appears to be present; however, this spectral region is convoluted by other decomposition products. 11B NMR indicates that the major reaction pathway results in hydrogen evolution with isobutane formation being present in smaller yields. The t-butyl substitution lowers the thermodynamic stability - compared to NH3BH3 - but results in impure hydrogen gas stream and lowered capacity due to isobutene evolution.

 Abstract:  Light metal borohydrides are considered as promising materials for solid state hydrogen storage. Because of the high hydrogen content of 11.5 wt % and the rather low dehydrogenation enthalpy of 32 Kj·mol-1H 2, Ca(BH4)2 is considered to be one of the most interesting compounds in this class of materials. In the present work, the effect of selected TM-fluoride (TM = transition metal) additives on the reversible formation of Ca(BH4)2 was investigated by means of thermovolumetric, calorimetric, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and ex situ, and in situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD) measurements. Furthermore, selected desorbed samples were analyzed by 11B{1H} solid state magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR). Under the conditions used in this study (145 bar H 2 pressure and 350 °C), TiF4 and NbF5 were the only additives causing partial reversibility. In these two cases, 11B{1H} MAS NMR analyses detected CaB6 and likely CaB12H12 in the dehydrogenation products.

 Abstract:  The dissolution of sodium chloride and sodium borohydride into each other resulting in formation of solid solutions of composition Na(BH4) 1-xClx is studied. The dissolution reaction is facilitated by two methods: ball milling or combination of ball milling and annealing at 300 °C for three days of NaBH4-NaCl samples in molar ratios of 0.5:0.5 and 0.75:0.25. The degree of dissolution is studied by Rietveld refinement of synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD) data. The results show that dissolution of 10 mol% NaCl into NaBH4, forming Na(BH4)0.9Cl0.1, takes place during ball milling. A higher degree of dissolution of NaCl in NaBH4 is obtained by annealing resulting in solid solutions containing up to 57 mol% NaCl, i.e. Na(BH4)0.43Cl0.57. In addition, annealing results in dissolution of 1020 mol% NaBH4 into NaCl.

 Abstract:  We investigated the structure, thermal properties, and dynamics of polyrotaxane (PR), composed of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and α-cyclodextrins (CDs), and PR derivatives comprising hydroxypropylated CDs, that is, hydroxypropylated PRs (HyPRs), in the solid state by using wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and viscoelastic spectroscopy. It was observed that HyPRs with high chemical modification ratios show a WLF-type viscoelastic relaxation that can be ascribed to the cooperative segmental motion of several CD molecules, whereas HyPRs with a lower modification ratio and PR with a highly ordered packing structure of CDs do not exhibit any mechanical relaxation mode. A comparison between the relaxation temperatures of HyPRs with different modification and inclusion ratios suggested that the hydrogen bond between CDs primarily dominates the viscoelastic properties of solid-state PR.

 Abstract:  High energy ball milling in a Fritsch P6 planetary ball mill was used for the synthesis of the nanocomposite of MgH2 with 10 wt.% of Cr 2O3 nanopowder catalyst (particle size <50 nm). After ball milling for 1 h the resulting grain size of β-MgH2 was equal to ∼30 nm. Subsequently, the nanocomposite was subjected to 150 desorption/absorption cycles at 325 °C. A gradual loss of hydrogen storage capacity upon cycling from ∼5.2 wt.% after 1 cycle to ∼4.6 wt.% after 150 cycles is observed on respective PCT curves obtained at 325 °C after every 25 cycles. The TPD curves temperature maxima are gradually shifted to a higher temperature range with increasing number of cycles which may indicate a lowering of the overall rate of transformation. Thorough microstructural investigations using such techniques as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the samples after 150 cycles of desorption/absorption show profound microstructural changes such as sintering of individual powder particles into agglomerates, increase in grain/crystallite size (>100 nm), segregation of the Cr2O3 particles to the interfaces between the sintered Mg particles and some reduction of Cr2O3 to Cr and MgO. All these microstructural changes seem to be responsible for the reduction of hydrogen storage capacity upon cycling and lowering the overall rate of transformation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the starting halides being non-porous, the trihalide syntheses occur homogeneously, in quantitative yields, and reversibly. In all cases halogen bond prevails over hydrogen bond, dihalogens substitute for the hydration water of starting halide anions and trihalides are formed. The stability of the obtained trihalides is mainly due to cooperative halogen bond and cation templation effect. Hexamethonium halides are proven effective solids for the clathration and storage of molecular dihalogens.

 Abstract:  NaBH 4 is considered as a promising candidate material for solid-state hydrogen storage due to its high hydrogen content of 10.6 wt %. However, its practical use is hampered by its high thermodynamic stability and slow H-exchange kinetics. In the present work, the effects of Ti-based additives, including Ti, TiH 2, and TiF 3, on the dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation of NaBH 4 (NaH+B) were investigated. It was revealed that all of the titanium-based additives were effective in improving the hydrogen desorption and absorption reactions of NaBH 4, and, among them, TiF 3 possessed the highest catalytic activity. The whole dehydrogenation process for the NaBH 4-0.05TiF 3 sample can be regarded as a two-step process: (i) a preferential reaction (3NaBH 4 + TiF 3 → 3NaF + TiB 2 + B + 6H 2) occurring at around 300 °C, and (ii) the formation of Ti- and F-containing species catalyze the dehydrogenation of the remaining NaBH 4. It was also indicated that the F anion can substitute for anionic H in NaH to form NaF 1-xH x in the case of NaH-B-0.05TiF 3 during the hydrogenation process. Therefore, the observed promotion effect of TiF 3 on the reversible dehydrogenation of NaBH 4 should be understood as arising from the combined effects of active Ti- and F-containing species. Also, FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of amorphous Na 2B 12H 12, in both the dehydrogenated and the rehydrogenated states, which may play a role in the partial dehydrogenation and reversibility observed in NaBH 4 with and without catalyst doping. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

Alfa Aesar LiAlH4 powder investigated in this work has the average particle size of 9.9 ± 5.2 μm as compared to 50-150 μm for Sigma-Aldrich LiAlH4 investigated by Ares et al. [9]. High energy ball milling reduced the particle size of the present LiAlH4 to 2.8 ± 2.3 μm. In general, comparing the results of our microstructural studies with those reported by Ares et al. [9] it is clear that the morphology, microstructure and chemistry of LiAlH4 can be very dissimilar depending on the supplier from which LiAlH4 powder was purchased. We do not observe a partial decomposition of LiAlH4 during milling up to 5 h under high energy impact mode. The observed melting of LiAlH4 in a DSC test is a very volatile event where the liquid LiAlH4 starts foaming and flowing out of the alumina crucible. After completion of solidification and desorption at temperatures above melting the powder resembles a lava rock. A thermal sectioning in DSC tests at pre-determined temperatures and subsequent XRD studies show that LiAlH4 starts decomposing into Li 3AlH6 immediately after melting. Li3AlH 6 seems to be already solidified before it starts decomposing in the next stage. All volumetric desorption curves at the 120-300 °C range clearly exhibit a two-stage desorption process, Stage I and II. As received LiAlH 4 is able, in a fully solid state, to desorb at 120 °C under pressure of 0.1 MPa H2 (atmospheric) as much as 7.1 wt.%H2 within ∼259,000 s (∼72 h), i.e. ∼93% of the purity-corrected H 2 content from the reactions in Stage I (LiAlH4(s) → (1/3)Li3AlH6(s) + (2/3)Al(s) + H2) and Stage II ((1/3)Li3AlH6(s) → LiH + (1/3)Al + 0.5H 2). The apparent activation energy for Stage I and II for unmilled LiAlH4 is equal to ∼111 and ∼100 kJ/mol, respectively. For the ball milled LiAlH4 the apparent activation energy for Stage I and II is slightly lower ∼92.5 and ∼92 kJ/mol, respectively. The water absorption up to 11.7% due to exposure to air for 1 h does not change in any drastic way the hydrogen desorption rate of ball milled LiAlH4 in Stage I. Flammability tests show that the ball milled LiAlH4 powder does not self-ignite on contact with air but can only be ignited by scraping the cylinder walls with a metal tool and then the powder burns with an open flame. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Some selected aspects of hydrogen interaction with metal surfaces are surveyed with emphasis on the formation of molecular precursor states on surfaces that are normally known to readily and spontaneously dissociate hydrogen molecules (Ni, Pd, Rh). We will demonstrate that the crystallographic (2 1 0) orientation of the face-centered cubic (""f.c.c"") lattice seems to provide a particular route for stabilizing a (weakly) chemisorbed H2 species notwithstanding the ordinary H2 dissociative chemisorption and - in the Pd case - subsurface H state formation. This molecular hydrogen species - although or just because it is bound with an adsorption energy of merely ∼20-25 kJ/mole may play an essential role both in heterogeneously catalysed surface and hydrogen uptake reactions that precede, e.g., H storage in solid materials. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  We studied a possibility of destabilization of MgH 2 by chemical reaction with Si by using a nano-engineering method for reducing diffusion distances and increasing surface area. The structure, morphology, chemical composition and dehydriding properties were investigated by XRD, SEM, EDS, DTA-TG and the volumetric Sievert method. The commercial MgH 2 and Si powder mixture corresponded to the stoichiometry of the ideal Mg 2Si intermetallic compound was ball-milled under argon atmosphere to reach a nanocrystalline composite structure (<50 nm). The ball-milling of the MgH 2-Si mixture leads to the formation only a small amount of the Mg 2Si compound. Microstructural studies showed that Si after ball-milling is heterogeneously distributed on the surface of MgH 2 particles and incorporated in the nanocrystalline MgH 2 matrix, forming a nanocomposite structure. The sluggish destabilization of MgH 2 by solid-state reaction with Si forming the Mg 2Si intermetallic compound was observed at 250 °C. The XRD and EDS analysis confirmed that the Mg 2Si compound is formed after the dehydrogenation of the synthesized MgH 2-Si composite. The activation energy of the destabilization reaction for the investigated composite significantly decreased (162 kJ/mol) as compared with unmilled MgH 2-Si powder mixture (213 kJ/mol).

 Abstract:  Novel nanowali arrays of hydrous manganese dioxide MnO2 0.SH2O are deposited onto cathodic substrates by the potentiostatic method from a mixed aqueous solution of manganese acetate and sodium sulfate. The deposition is induced by a change of local pH resulting from electrolysis of H2O, and hierarchical mesoporous nanowali arrays are formed as a result of simultaneous precipitation of manganese hydroxide and release of hydrogen gas bubbles from the cathode. The morphology and lithium ion intercalation properties are found to change appreciably with the concentration of the precursor electrolyte, with a significant reduction In specific surface area with an increased precursor concentration. For example, mesoporous nanowali arrays deposited from 0.1 M solution possess a surface area of -96 m 2 g-1 and exhibit a stable high intercalation capacity of 256 mA hg-1 with a film of 0.5 μm in thickness, far exceeding the theoretical limit of 150 mA hg-1 for manganese dioxide bulk film. Such mesopurous nanowall arrays offer much greater energy storage capacity (e.g., -230 mA hg-1 for films of -2.5 μm) than that of anodic deposited films of the same thickness (-30 mA hg-1). Such high lithium ion intercalation capacity and excellent cyclic stability of the mesopurous nanowali arrays, especially for thicker films, are ascribed to the hierarchically structured macro- and mesoporosity of the MhO2 0.5H2O nanowall arrays, which offer large surface to volume ratio favoring interface Faradaic reactions, short solid-state diffusion paths, and freedom to permit volume change during lithium ion intercalation and de-intercalation. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Seperate the questions with commasTitle:Engineering hydrogen storage systems
 Abstract:  Increased research into the chemistry, physics and material science of hydrogen cycling compounds has led to the rapid growth of solid-phase hydrogen-storage options. The operating conditions of these new options span a wide range: system temperature can be as low as 70K or over 600K, system pressure varies from less than 100kPa to 35MPa, and heat loads can be moderate or can be measured in megawatts. While the intense focus placed on storage materials has been appropriate, there is also a need for research in engineering, specifically in containment, heat transfer, and controls. The DOE's recently proposed engineering center of expertise' underscores the growing understanding that engineering research will play a role in the success of advanced hydrogen storage systems. Engineering a hydrogen system will minimally require containment of the storage media and control of the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes, but an elegant system design will compensate for the storage media's weaker aspects and capitalize on its strengths. To achieve such a complete solution, the storage tank must be designed to work with the media, the vehicle packaging, the power-plant, and the power-plant's control system. In some cases there are synergies available that increase the efficiency of both subsystems simultaneously. In addition, system designers will need to make the hard choices needed to convert a technically feasible concept into a commercially successful product. Materials cost, assembly cost, and end of life costs will all shape the final design of a viable hydrogen storage system. Once again there is a critical role for engineering research, in this case into lower cost and higher performance engineering materials. Each form of hydrogen storage has its own, unique, challenges and opportunities for the system designer. These differing requirements stem directly from the properties of the storage media. Aside from physical containment of compressed or liquefied hydrogen, most storage media can be assigned to one of four major categories, chemical storage, metal hydrides, complex hydrides, or physisorption. Specific needs of each technology are discussed below. Physisorption systems currently operate at 77K with very fast kinetics and good gravimetric capacity; and as such, special engineering challenges center on controlling heat transfer. Excellent MLVSI is available, its cost is high and it is not readily applied to complex shape in a mass manufacture setting. Additionally, while the heat of adsorption on most physisorbents is a relatively modest 6-10kJ/mol H2, this heat must be moved up a 200K gradient. Physisorpion systems are also challenged on density. Consequently, methods for reducing the cost of producing and assembling compact, high-quality insulation, tank design to minimize heat transfer while maintaining manufacturability, improved methods of heat transfer to and from the storage media, and controls to optimize filling are areas of profitable research. It may be noted that the first two areas would also contribute to improvement of liquid hydrogen tanks. Metal hydrides are currently nearest application in the form of high pressure metal hydride tanks because of their reduced volume relative to compressed gas tanks of the same capacity and pressure. These systems typically use simple pressure controls, and have enthalpies of roughly 20kJ/mol H2 and plateau pressures of at most a few MPa. During filling, temperatures must be high enough to ensure fast kinetics, but kept low enough that the thermodynamically set plateau pressure is well below the filling pressure. To accomplish this balance the heat transfer system must handle on the order of 300kW during the 5 minute fill of a 10kg tank. These systems are also challenged on mass and the cost of the media. High value areas for research include: heat transfer inside a 35MParated pressure vessel, light and strong tank construction materials with reduced cost, and metals or other materials that do not embrittle in the presence of high pressure hydrogen when operated below -400K. The latter two topics would also have a beneficial impact on compressed gas hydrogen storage systems, the current ""system to beat"" Complex hydrides frequently have high hydrogen capacity but also an enthalpy of adsorption >30kJ/mol H2, a hydrogen release temperature >370K, and in many cases multiple steps of adsorption/desorption with slow kinetics in at least one of the steps. Most complex hydrides are thermal insulators in the hydrided form. From an engineering perspective, improved methods and designs for cost effective heat transfer to the storage media in a 5 to 10MPa vessel is of significant interest, as are materials that resist embrittlement at pressures below 1 OMPa and temperatures below 500K. Chemical hydrides produce heat when releasing hydrogen; in some systems this can be managed with air cooling of the reactor, but in other systems that may not be possible. In general, chemical hydrides must be removed from the vehicle and regenerated off-board. They are challenged on durability and recycling energy. Engineering research of interest in these systems centers around maintaining the spent fuel in a state suitable for rapid removal while minimizing system mass, and on developing highly efficient recycling plant designs that make the most of heat from exothermic steps. While the designs of each category of storage tank will differ with the material properties, two common engineering research thrusts stand out, heat transfer and structural materials. In addition, control strategies are important to all advanced storage systems, though they will vary significantly from system to system. Chemical systems need controls primarily to match hydrogen supply to power-plant demand, including shut down. High pressure metal hydride systems will need control during filling to maintain an appropriately low plateau pressure. Complex hydrides will need control for optimal filling and release of hydrogen from materials with multi-step reactions. Even the relatively simple compressed-gas tanks require control strategies during refill. Heat transfer systems will modulate performance and directly impact cost. While issues such as thermal conductivity may not be as great as anticipated, the heat transfer system still impacts gravimetric efficiency, volumetric efficiency and cost. These are three key factors to commercial viability, so any research that improves performance or reduces cost is important. Recent work in the DOE FreedomCAR program indicates that some 14% of the system mass may be attributed to heat transfer in complex hydride systems2. If this system is made to withstand 100 bar at 450K the material cost will be a meaningful portion of the total tank cost. Improvements to the basic shell and tube structures that can reduce the total mass of heat transfer equipment while maintaining good global and local temperature control are needed. Reducing the mass and cost of the materials of construction would also benefit all systems. Much has been made of the need to reduce the cost of carbon fiber in compressed tanks and new processes are being investigated. Further progress is likely to benefit any composite tank, not just compressed gas tanks. In a like fashion, all tanks have metal parts. Today those parts are made from expensive alloys, such as A286. If other structural materials could be proven suitable for tank construction there would be a direct cost benefit to all tank systems. Finally there is a need to match the system to the storage material and the power-plant. Recent work has shown there are strong effects of material properties on system performance , not only because of the material, but also because the material properties drive the tank design to be more or less efficient. Filling of a hydride tank provides an excellent example. A five minute or less fill time is desirable. Hydrogen will be supplied as a gas, perhaps at a fixed pressure and temperature. The kinetics of the hydride will dictate how fast hydrogen can be absorbed, and the thermodynamics will determine if hydrogen can be absorbed at all; both properties are temperature dependent. The temperature will depend on how fast heat is generated by absorption and how fast heat can be added or removed by the system. If the design system and material properties are not both well suited to this filling scenario the actual amount of hydrogen stored could be significantly less than the capacity of the system. Controls may play an important role as well, by altering the coolant temperature and flow, and the gas temperature and pressure, a better fill is likely. Similar strategies have already been demonstrated for compressed gas systems . Matching system capabilities to power-plant needs is also important. Supplying the demanded fuel in transients and start up are obvious requirements that both the tank system and material must be design to meet. But there are opportunities too. If the power-plant heat can be used to release hydrogen, then the efficiency of vehicle increases greatly. This efficiency comes not only from preventing hydrogen losses from supplying heat to the media, but also from the power-plant cooling that occurs. To reap this benefit, it will be important to have elegant control strategies that avoid unwanted feedback between the power-plant and the fuel system. Hydrogen fueled vehicles are making tremendous strides, as can be seen by the number and increasing market readiness of vehicles in technology validation programs. Research that improves the effectiveness and reduces the costs of heat transfer systems, tank construction materials, and control systems will play a key role in preparing advanced hydrogen storage systems to be a part of this transportation revolution.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen adsorption and storage using solid-state materials is an area of much current research interest, and one of the major stumbling blocks in realizing the hydrogen economy. However, no material yet researched comes close to reaching the DOE 2015 targets of 9 wt% and 80 kgm-3 at this time. To increase the physisorption capacities of these materials, the heats of adsorption must be increased to ̃20 kJ mol-1. This can be accomplished by optimizing the material structure, creating more active species on the surface, or improving the interaction of the surface with hydrogen. The main focus of this progress report are recent advances in physisorption materials exhibiting higher heats of adsorption and better hydrogen adsorption at room temperature based on exploiting the Kubas model for hydrogen binding: (η2-H2)-metal interaction. Both computational approaches and synthetic achievements will be discussed.

 Abstract:  The Laves phases family, AB2 (A = 3B, 4B, rare earth or actinide; B = transition metal) is among the largest of binary intermetallic systems. They readily absorb hydrogen and as such they are of potential use for energy storage. This work presents a thorough electronic and magnetic structure study within these systems among which we select ScFe2 and its hydride ScFe2H2 which crystallize in the C14 (2H) hexagonal structure. The relevance of this study for solid state chemistry pertains to the complexity brought by the presence of two distinct crystal sites for Fe with different magnetic properties (ordered moments, hyperfine fields) and bonding with hydrogen whose insertion sites were to be defined. Such issues, not considered experimentally, are addressed here within the well-established quantum mechanical density functional theoretical framework (DFT) using both pseudo-potential calculations for geometry optimization and all-electrons investigations for full study of the electronic, chemical bonding and magnetic structure properties. From energy-volume quadratic curves providing the equation of state, the hydride is found more compressible at a higher equilibrium volume than the pristine intermetallic. This stresses the negative pressure brought by hydrogen. Cohesive energy studies show the stability of hydrogen within ScFe2. From electron localization function (ELF) plots the expected picture of a negatively charged hydrogen within an alloy lattice is obtained. The chemical bond of H within the A2B2 tetrahedron formed of Sc and one type of Fe is discussed. Magnetic moments and Fermi contact term HFC of the effective hyperfine field Heff are found within range of the average experimental values in both the alloy and its hydride. For ScFe2H2 a peculiar feature of the magnetic moment magnitude inversion and of HFC for the two iron sites is found to be connected with a change in magnetic characters of the two Fe sites, becoming strongly and weakly ferromagnetic, respectively, for the isolated iron and the H connected Fe. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

 Abstract:  Mechanochemical transformations of tetrahydroaluminates and amides of lithium and sodium have been investigated using gas volumetric analysis, X-ray powder diffraction, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and transmission electron microscopy. In a transformation of LiAlH4 and LiNH2 taken in an 1:1 molar ratio, the amount of released hydrogen (6.6 wt.% after 30 min ball milling) was higher than in any known one pot mechanochemical process involving a hydrogen-containing solid. A total of 4.3 wt.% of hydrogen is released by the NaAlH4-NaNH2 system after 60 min ball milling; and 5.2 wt.% H2 is released when LiAlH4 and NaNH2 or NaAlH4 and LiNH2 are ball milled for 90 min and 120 min, respectively. All transformations proceed at room temperature. The mechanism of the overall transformation MAlH4(s) + MNH2(s) → 2MH(s) + AlN(s) + 2H2(g) was identified based on detailed spectroscopic analysis of the intermediate (M3AlH6) and final products of the ball milling process. © 2007 Acta Materialia Inc.

Oxidation of the material was reduced through the use of a sandwiched free-standing film structure in which the top and bottom layers consist of nanometer-thick Pd layers, which also acted as a catalyst to promote hydrogen uptake and release. Hydrogen storage characteristics were studied at three temperatures, 296, 232, and 180°C, where multiple sorption/desorption cycles were measured gravimetrically. An improvement in hydrogen storage capacity over the bulk Mg-Ni target material was found for the free-standing films. As shown from a Van't Hoff plot, the thermodynamic stability of the nanograined films is similar to that of Mg2Ni. These results suggest that free-standing films, of which better control of material compositions and microstructures can be realized than is possible for conventional ball-milled powders, represent a useful materials platform for solid-state hydrogen storage research.

 Abstract:  Different boron-doped carbon nanotubes with dispersed Ni atoms as potential hydrogen storage materials are investigated using first-principles density functional theory. Our results show that substitution of neighboring two carbon atoms with boron atoms can improve the adsorption of Ni atom on the tube and fix the Ni atom around boron atoms, which prevent the aggregation of the Ni atoms on the surface.

 Abstract:  A thermodynamical model of hydrogen storage in slitpores is presented and applied to carbon and BN nanoporous materials. The model accounts for the quantum effects of the molecules in the confining potential of the slitpores. A feature of the model is a new equation of state (EOS) of hydrogen, valid over a range of pressures wider than any other known EOS, obtained using experimental data in the range 77-300 K and 0-1000 MPa, including data in the region of solid hydrogen. The model reproduces the experimental hydrogen storage properties of different samples of activated carbons and carbide-derived carbons at 77 and 298 K and at pressures between 0 and 20 MPa, for an average nanopore width of about 5 Å. The model predicts that in order to reach the US Department of Energy hydrogen storage targets for 2010, the nanopore widths should be equal to or larger than 5.6 Å for applications at low temperatures, 77 K, and any pressure, and about 6 Å for applications at 300 K and at least 10 MPa. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

 Abstract:  We investigate the encapsulation of hydrogen molecules in a C120 nanocapsule by using the density-functional-based tight binding (DFTB) method for geometry optimization and ab initio DFT approach for total energy calculations. It has been found that up to eight hydrogen molecules were encapsulated inside the C120 cage can form the stable complex. We show that for large numbers of encapsulated hydrogen molecules, some of them become chemisorbed on the inner surface of the cage. We found also that for nH2 = 54 the capsule side wall breaks and the mechanism of its breaking is studied by density-functional-based tight binding molecular dynamics (DF-TBMD) simulation thus this complex seems to be highly improbable. Our first-principles calculations predict that the hydrogen adsorptive capacity of C120 nanocapsules is higher than that of C60 fullerene. This demonstrates that C120 nanocapsules could be a promising material for energy storage. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen storage properties of two ball-milled composites of Ca(NH2)2 + 2LiH and CaH2 + 2LiNH2 were investigated as a series of searching studies of high performance hydrogen storage materials. About 4.5 mass% hydrogen is desorbed from about 100 °C and the thermal desorption profiles show a peak around 200 and 220 °C for the composites of CaH2 + 2LiNH2 and Ca(NH2)2 + 2LiH, respectively, under a helium flow at 5 °C/min heating rate without any NH3 emission within our experimental accuracy. The powder X-ray diffraction and infrared absorption spectroscopy indicated that the dehydrogenated states of both composites form ""an unknown imide phase"" after heating up to 400 °C, while the dehydrogenated states after heating up to 200 °C in vacuum are the mixed phases of Li2NH and CaNH. The rehydrogenated state for the ball-milled composite of CaH2 + 2LiNH2 is transformed into the composite of Ca(NH2)2 and 2LiH by repeating the dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation cycles at 180-200 °C. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  The size dependencies of the hydrogen-storage properties in polymer-coated Pd nanoparticles with diameters of 2.6 ± 0.4 and 7.0 ± 0.9 nm were investigated by a measurement of hydrogen pressure-composition isotherms. Their storage capacities per constituent Pd atom in the particles decreased with decreasing particle size, whereas the hydrogen concentrations in the two kinds of nanoparticles were almost the same and 1.2 times as much, respectively, as that in bulk palladium after counting zero hydrogen occupancy on the atoms in the first surface layer of the particles. Furthermore, apparent changes in hydrogen absorption behavior with decreasing particle size were observed, that is, a narrowing of the two-phase regions of solid-solution and hydride phases, the lowering of the equilibrium hydrogen pressure, and a decrease in the critical temperature of the two-phase state. By analyzing the isotherms, we quantitatively determined the heat of formation (ΔH α-β) and the entropy change (ΔS α-β) in the hydride formation of the nanoparticle. ΔHα-β and ΔSα-β for the 2.6 ± 0.4 nm diameter Pd nanoparticle were -34.6 ± 0.61 kJ(H 2 mol)-1 and -83.1 ± 1.8 J(H2 mol) -1K-1, whereas for the 7.0 ± 0.9 nm diameter Pd nanoparticles the values were -31.0 ± 1.8 kJ(H2 mol) -1 and -67.3 ± 5.1 J(H2 mol)-1K -1, respectively.

The new adsorption sites have binding energies that are stronger than that observed for hydrogen physisorbed on planar graphite, but significantly weaker than a chemical C-H bond. Volumetric measurements at 77 K and 2 bar show a hydrogen adsorption capacity of 0.5 wt%. Interestingly, the BET surface area is -31 m2/g after degassing, which is approximately an order of magnitude less than expected given the measured experimental hydrogen capacity.

 Abstract:  A mechanochemical synthesis process has been used to synthesise aluminium nanoparticles. The aluminium is synthesised via a solid state chemical reaction which is initiated inside a ball mill at room temperature between either lithium (Li) or sodium (Na) metal which act as reducing agents with unreduced aluminium chloride (AlCl3). The reaction product formed consists of aluminium nanoparticles embedded within a by-product salt phase (LiCl or NaCl, respectively). The LiCl is washed with a suitable solvent resulting in aluminium (Al) nanoparticles which are not oxidised and are separated from the by-product phase. Synthesis and washing was confirmed using X-ray diffraction (XRD). Nanoparticles were found to be ∼25-100 nm from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and an average size of 55 nm was determined from small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements. As synthesised Al/NaCl composites, washed Al nanoparticles, and purchased Al nanoparticles were deuterium (D2) absorption tested up to 2 kbar at a variety of temperatures, with no absorption detected within system resolution. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Direct synthesis of Zr-based AB2-type hydrogen storage alloys (HSAs) from mixed oxide precursors has been achieved by electrolysis in molten CaCl2 at 900 °C and a cell voltage below 3.2 V. The process resembled direct oxide-to-metal conversion in solid state, and the target alloys, namely ZrCr2, ZrCr0.7Ni1.3 and Zr 0.5Ti0.5V0.5Cr0.2Ni1.3, were formed in situ during electrolysis without going through any melting step. Electrolysis energy consumption could be as low as 9.59 kWh (kg-HSA) -1 and the metal recovery yield was generally higher than 90%. The electrolytic products were readily obtained as powders with the designated compositions and crystal structures (e.g. the C14 and C15 Laves phases). More importantly, these Zr-based electrolytic HSA powders were composed of nodular micro-particles which are very desirable for fabrication of electrodes with micro-porosity to facilitate electrolyte ex- and ingression. Galvanostatic discharge-charge tests of the as-prepared electrolytic HSA powders resulted in similar or higher hydrogen storage capacities (up to 280 mAh g-1) in comparison with the same HSAs prepared by e.g. arc-melting the individual metals as reported in literature. Particularly, the electrolytic Zr-based HSAs were unique for their high initial capacities without any pre-treatment for activation, and they also exhibited highly satisfactory discharge rate capability with less than 20% capacity loss when the discharge current increased from 50 to 600 mA g-1. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Lithium tetrahydridoboranate is among the materials with the highest hydrogen content and has great potential as a possible H2-storage material, although, the release and uptake of H2 is not fully understood. In this work, LiBH4 was studied by in situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (PXD) and solid state CP/MAS NMR both at variable temperatures. This study revealed two new phases observed during dehydrogenation of LiBH4. Phase I is hexagonal, a = 4.93(2) and c = 13.47(3) Å and is observed in the temperature range ∼200-300 °C, and phase II is orthorhombic, a = 8.70(1), b = 5.44(1) and c = 4.441(8) Å and is observed in the temperature range ∼300-400 °C applying a constant heating rate of 5 °C/min. Apparently, I transforms into II, e.g. at a constant temperature of T = 265 °C after 5 h. Furthermore, a third phase, III, is observed in the temperature range RT to 70 °C, and is caused by a reaction between LiBH4 and water vapor from the atmosphere.

 Abstract:  Understanding transport phenomena of fluids through nanotubes (NTs) is of great interest in order to enable potential application of NTs as separation devices, encapsulation media for molecule storage and delivery, and sensors. Single-walled metal oxide NTs are interesting materials because they present a well-defined solid-state structure, precisely tunable diameter and length, as well as a hydrophilic and functionalizable interior for tuning transport and adsorption selectivity. Here, we study the transport properties of hydrogen-bonding liquids (water, methanol, and ethanol) through a single-walled aluminosilicate NT to investigate the influence of liquid-surface and liquid-liquid interactions and the effects of competitive transport of different chemical species using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The self-diffusivities (D s) for all the three species decrease with increasing loading and are comparable to bulk liquid diffusivities at low molecular loadings. We show that the hydrogen-bond network associated with water makes its diffusion behavior different from methanol and ethanol. Mixtures of water and methanol show segregation in the NT, with water located closer to the tube wall and the alcohol molecules localized near the center of the NT. D s values of water in an analogous aluminogermanate NT are larger than those in the aluminosilicate NT due to a larger pore diameter. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Ammonia borane (AB) is of great interest for storing hydrogen, an important issue in the growing field of hydrogen technology. The reaction pathways leading to the thermal decomposition of solid-state AB incorporated in carbon cryogels (CC) have been studied by spectroscopic methods. The time-dependent thermal decomposition was followed by in situ 11B nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and showed a significant increase in hydrogen release kinetics for AB in CC compared to neat AB. Both 11B NMR and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy show a new reaction product, formed in the thermal decomposition of AB in CC scaffold (CC - AB) that is assigned to reactions with surface oxygen groups. The results indicate that incorporation of AB in CC enhances kinetics because of the reactions with residual surface-bound oxygen functional groups. The formation of new products with surface - O - B bonds is consistent with the greater reaction exothermicity observed when hydrogen is released from CC - AB materials.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen desorption properties of mechanically milled materials composed of nano-structural hydrogenated-graphite (CnanoHx) and alkali(-earth) metal hydride (MH; M = Na, Mg and Ca) were investigated from the thermodynamic and structural points of view. The hydrogen desorption temperature for all the CnanoHx and MH composites was obviously lower than that of the corresponding each hydride. In addition, the desorption of hydrocarbons from CnanoHx was significantly suppressed by making composite of CnanoHx with MH, even though CnanoHx itself thermally desorbs a considerably large amount of hydrocarbons. These results indicate that an interaction exists between CnanoHx and MH, and hydrogen in both the phases is destabilized by a close contact between polar C-H groups in CnanoHx and the MH solid phase. Moreover, a new type of chemical bonding between the nano-structural carbon (Cnano) and the Li, Ca, or Mg metal atoms may be formed after hydrogen desorption. Thus, the above metal-C-H system would be recognized as a new family of H-storage materials. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  In this study we discuss a process of mechanical activation employed in place of chemical or thermal activation to improve the mobility and reactivity of hydrogen atoms and ions in nanomaterials for energy applications: rechargeable batteries and hydrogen storage for fuel cell systems. Two materials are discussed. Both are used or intended for use in power sources. One is nickel hydroxide, Ni(OH) 2, which converts to oxyhydroxide in the positive Ni electrode of rechargeable metal hydride batteries. The other is a complex hydride, Mg(AIH 4) 2, intended for use in reversible, solid- state hydrogen storage for fuel cells. The feature shared by these unlikely materials (hydroxide and hydride) is a sheet-like hexagonal crystal structure. The mechanical activation was conducted in high-energy ball mills. We discuss and demonstrate that the mechanical excitation of atoms and ions imparted on these powders stems from the same class of phenomena. These are (i) proliferation of structural defects, in particular stacking faults in a sheet-like structure of hexagonal crystals, and (ii) possible fragmentation of a faulted structure into a mosaic of layered nanocrystals. The hydrogen atoms bonded in such nanocrystals may be inserted and abstracted more easily from OH - hydroxyl group in Ni(OH) 2 and AIH4 4 hydride complex in Mg(AIH 4) 2 during hydrogen charge and discharge reactions. However, the effects of mechanical excitation imparted on these powders are different. While the Ni(OH) 2 powder is greatly activated for cycling in batteries, the Mg(AIH 4) 2 complex hydride phase is greatly destabilized for use in reversible hydrogen storage. Such a ""synchronic"" view of the structure-property relationship in respect to materials involved in hydrogen energy storage and conversion is supported in experiments employing X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and direct imaging of the structure with a high-resolution transmission-electron microscope (HREM), as well as in property characterization.

 Abstract:  Theoretical studies have predicted that scandium can bind to the twelve five-membered rings in C60. It is then possible to stabilize four dihydrogen ligands (H2) on each Sc atom with a binding energy of ∼30 kJ/mol, ideal for vehicular hydrogen storage. The resulting C 60[ScH2(H2)4]12 complex is predicted to be a minimum energy structure with ∼7.0 wt% reversible hydrogen capacity. However, wet chemical synthesis of the calculated η5-coordinated fullerene complex is unprecedented. The chemistry of C60 is generally olefinic (i.e., η2-coordination, in which the metal is coordinated to two carbon atoms contributing two electrons to the bonding). Furthermore, stabilization of multiple dihydrogen ligands on a single transition metal has not been demonstrated. Recently we have probed new synthesis techniques in order to coordinate C60 with either Fe, Sc, Cr, Co or Li. The new compounds were characterized with solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, and structures have been proposed.

 Abstract:  Several researchers present a viewpoint set to inform the scientific community about the present state of affairs in borderline fields of hydrogen storage materials, scientific problems and express their opinion about scientific or technical opportunities for the further development. The first two papers will address the most common types of physiosorption materials, nanocarbon and selforganizing metal organic frameworks which can be optimized in terms of pore size, pore shape, and chemical functionality of the inner surfaces. The third paper shall report about the first new generation of lightweight materials, which offer much higher gravimetric storage densities for hydrogen than classical interstitial hydrides consisting of heavy transition. No. 6 will show that it is possible to combine binary metal hydrides and complex hydrides in a solid-state reaction, where hydrogen is exchanged.

 Abstract:  Solid-state reactions of Ca(AlH4)2 and various additives were investigated experimentally for hydrogen desorption. The Ca(AlH4)2 + Si, Ca(AlH4)2 + 2MgH2, Ca(AlH4)2 + 2LiH, and Ca(AlH 4)2 + 2LiNH2 systems were chosen among reactions proposed theoretically1 to study their hydrogen storage capacity and an appropriate reaction enthalpy. For all systems investigated, the reversible reactions proposed should have more than 6.5 mass % hydrogen capacity and reaction enthalpies in the range of 30-55 kJ/mol H2. However, most of the experimentally observed reactions do not conform to theoretical propositions because different final products were obtained in all cases but one. Two tendencies were observed in the experiments. One is that the reaction comprises several distinct steps at different temperatures as observed in the Ca(AlH4)2 + Si and Ca(AlH4)2 + 2 MgH2 systems. In this case, Ca(AlH4)2 decomposes first and is followed by a reaction of the remaining compounds. The same kinetic reaction barriers are encountered here as in pure Ca(AlH 4)2. Second, LiH and LiNH2 additions yield exothermic reactions of Ca(AlH4)2 and the other reactant as early as in the ball milling or annealing steps, leading to final products not considered in the reactions calculated. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Ti decorated BC-4N nanotube has been studied using first-principles density functional approach, to explore the storage of molecular hydrogen. It combines the advantages of carbon nanotube, together with the thermal stability of BN nanotube. The local structural unit of BN3 and NB3 linked with B-N bonds are responsible for the extra stability of BC-4N nanotube as compared with CNT. While the host carbon nanotube is metallic, the substitutional doping of B and N with a large enough concentration (33%) turns it to semiconducting. Endohedral decoration, although energetically favourable, encounters a rather high barrier height of ∼4 eV, as obtained from our nudge elastic band calculation of the minimum energy path. Exohedral Ti@BC 4N can bind up to four H2 molecules. For full Ti coverage, the system can absorb up to 56 wt% of hydrogen. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation reveals that at 500 K hydrogen gets released in molecular form. We believe that this novel composite nanotube, functionalized by Ti atoms from outside, serves as a promising system for hydrogen storage. © Indian Academy of Sciences.

 Abstract:  A good method to store hydrogen is in it atomic form in crystalline structure of metals at low pressure. Thanks to magnesium's high hydrogen storage capacity, its low weight and its high natural abundance, it is an attractive material to develop hydrogen solid state storage. The production of Mg-based nanocomposites can enhance the kinetics of H-sorption of magnesium and the temperature of release of hydrogen. Transition metals as iron, which have important catalytic activity in hydrogen reactions with Mg, and the surface protective compound MgF2, are interesting additions for magnesium mixtures for hydrogen storage. In this work, Mg-based nanocomposites containing Fe and MgF2 were produced by reactive milling under hydrogen using the addition of FeF3, or directly MgF2 and Fe. The efficiency of centrifugal and planetary mill in MgH2 synthesis was compared. The phase evolution during different milling times (from 1 to 96 h) using the planetary was investigated. The different H-desorption behavior of selected milled mixtures was studied and associated with the different present phases in each case.

 Abstract:  Proof-of-principle gas-reservoir MnNiMg electrochromic mirror devices have been investigated. In contrast to conventional electrochromic approaches, hydrogen is stored (at low concentration) in the gas volume between glass panes of the insulated glass units (IGUs). The elimination of a solid state ion storage layer simplifies the layer stack, enhances overall transmission, and reduces cost. The cyclic switching properties were demonstrated and system durability improved with the incorporation a thin Zr barrier layer between the MnNiMg layer and the Pd catalyst. Addition of 9% silver to the palladium catalyst further improved system durability. About 100 full cycles have been demonstrated before devices slow considerably. Degradation of device performance appears to be related to Pd catalyst mobility, rather than delamination or metal layer oxidation issues originally presumed likely to present significant challenges. © 2008.

 Abstract:  The nucleation process strongly influences the phase transformation kinetics that determine the final microstructure and thereby the mechanical properties of the material. The role of grain and phase boundary misorientations during the solid-state nucleation of a BCC phase in a FCC phase has been investigated. 3D EBSD measurements were performed on a Co-15Fe alloy with both the FCC and BCC phases stable at room temperature in order to measure the crystallographic orientation of the BCC precipitates and FCC grains and the orientation relationship between the FCC and BCC crystallites. In this paper the preliminary results from the analysis of the data show that specific orientation relationships between BCC and FCC crystal structures play an important role during this process.

 Abstract:  Stepwise solid-state reaction between LiNH2 and LiAlH 4 at a molar ratio of 2:1 is investigated in this paper.

The NMR data, together with the results of X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform IR measurements, indicate that a Li-Al-N-H intermediate with the chemical composition of Li 3AlN2H4 forms after ball milling. Heating the post-milled sample to 500°C results in the liberation of an additional four H atoms and the formation of Li3AlN2. More than 5 wt % hydrogen can be reversibly stored by Li3AlN2.

 Abstract:  Intermetallic compounds are able to store reversibly large amount of hydrogen. The hydride formation usually takes place through a two-phase domain for which an equilibrium plateau is observed between the metallic phase and its hydride. Such phase transformation induces important structural changes such as volume expansion (either isotropic and anisotropic), symmetry lowering, hydrogen ordering and phase transitions. In some cases, change of the electronic structure, from metallic to ionocovalent state, is reported. Finally, amorphization can occur leading to disproportionation of the parent compound. In this overview we give some examples of these different behaviors to illustrate the fascinating structural properties of these materials that are of potential interest from the fundamental point of view and for practical applications like energy storage either by solid-gas or electrochemical routes. © by Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, München.

"Seperate the questions with commasTitle:Prototype electrostatic ground state approach to predicting crystal structures of ionic compounds: Application to hydrogen storage materials
 Abstract:  We have developed a procedure for crystal structure generation and prediction for ionic compounds consisting of a collection of cations and rigid complex anions. Our approach is based on global optimization of an energy functional consisting of the electrostatic and soft-sphere repulsive energies using Metropolis Monte Carlo (MMC) simulated annealing in conjunction with smoothing of the potential energy landscape via the distance scaling method. The resulting structures, or prototype electrostatic ground states (PEGS), are subsequently relaxed using first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) calculations to obtain accurate structural parameters and thermodynamic properties. This method is shown to produce the ground state structures of NaAl H4 and Mg (Al H4) 2, as well as the mixed cation alanate K2 LiAl H6. For LiAl H4, the PEGS search produces a structure with a static DFT total energy equal to that of the experimentally observed structure; the latter is stabilized by vibrational contributions to the free energy. For mixed-valence hexa-alanates, XY Al H6, where X= (Li,Na,K), and Y= (Mg,Ca), the PEGS method predicts six unsuspected structure types, which are not found in the existing structure databases. The PEGS search yields energies that are, on the average, better than the best database structures with the same number of atoms per unit cell, demonstrating the predictive power and usefulness of the PEGS structures. In addition to the recently synthesized LiMgAl H6 compound, we predict that LiCaAl H6, NaCaAl H6, and KCaAl H6 are also thermodynamically stable with respect to phase separation into other alanates and metal hydrides. In contrast, NaMgAl H6 and KMgAl H6 are slightly unstable (by less than 3 kJ mol) relative to the phase separation into NaAl H4, KAl H4, and Mg H2. We suggest that solid-state ion-exchange reactions between X3 Al H6 (X=Li,Na,K) and Y Cl2 (Y=Mg,Ca) could be used to synthesize the predicted mixed-valence hexa-alanates. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

 Abstract:  Solid aluminum hydride, AlH3, has been proposed and studied for applications in hydrogen storage. In some samples, a comparatively narrow feature in the proton NMR spectrum is observed; we demonstrate here that this peak is due to molecular hydrogen (H2) trapped within the solid, presumably from earlier processing procedures or partial decomposition. Static and magic-angle spinning NMR show that the responsible species is highly mobile, even at 11 K. Neutron-energy-gain spectra obtained at 3.5 K yield a feature at or near the free-rotor H2 energy difference between the J = 1 and J = 0 states.

 Abstract:  A shape memory thermoplastic polyurethane (PU) as a phase change material (PCM) was synthesized by employing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as the soft segment via bulk polymerization. Its phase separation structure, crystalline morphology, phase change behaviors, dynamic mechanical properties and melt-processing ability were investigated using polarizing optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis, thermogravimetry and melt flow index. A well-formed phase separation structure in the PEG-based polyurethane (PEGPU) was found which accounts for most of the material phase change properties and shape memory effect. The PEG soft segment phase transition between crystalline and amorphous states resulted in heat storage and release of the PEGPU. Due to the hydrogen bonded hard segment phase serving as ""physical cross-linking"" restricted the free movement of the soft segments, at temperature above the PEG phase melting transition, the PEGPU was still solid. The differential scanning calorimetry results indicated that the PEGPU had high latent heat storage capacity of more than 100 J/g. The dynamic mechanical analysis results showed that it had a plateau elastic modulus about 40 MPa in the region above the PEG phase melting transition while below 150 °C. The thermogravimetry results suggested that the PEGPU had a much broader applicable temperature range compared with pure PEG.

 Abstract:  A workshop, 'Theory Meets Industry', was held on 12-14 June 2007 in Vienna, Austria, attended by a well balanced number of academic and industrial scientists from America, Europe, and Japan. The focus was on advances in ab initio solid state calculations and their practical use in industry. The theoretical papers addressed three dominant themes, namely (i) more accurate total energies and electronic excitations, (ii) more complex systems, and (iii) more diverse and accurate materials properties. Hybrid functionals give some improvements in energies, but encounter difficulties for metallic systems. Quantum Monte Carlo methods are progressing, but no clear breakthrough is on the horizon. Progress in order-N methods is steady, as is the case for efficient methods for exploring complex energy hypersurfaces and large numbers of structural configurations. The industrial applications were dominated by materials issues in energy conversion systems, the quest for hydrogen storage materials, improvements of electronic and optical properties of microelectronic and display materials, and the simulation of reactions on heterogeneous catalysts.

 Abstract:  Crystal structures and hydrogen storage properties of compounds belonging to the Li-Mg-N-H system are studied using first-principles DFT calculations and the grand-canonical linear programming approach (Akbarzadeh, et al. AdV. Mater. 2007, 19, 3233). We report the static, zero-point, and T ≥ 0 K vibrational energies of all known storage compounds belonging to this system along with new predictions for Li4Mg(NH)3, Li2Mg(NH) 2, and MgNH. Enthalpies, entropies, and hydrogen release temperatures are calculated for all thermodynamically reversible dehydrogenation reactions occurring within 300 °C of room temperature. Using a structural enumeration approach based on the antifluorite lattice of Li2NH, we find a new Li2Mg(NH)2 structure of Pca21 symmetry, which has a lower T = 0 K energy than the previously reported Iba2 phase. For the mixed imide Li4Mg(NH)3, enumeration finds a structure belonging to the Imm2 space group with two formula units per conventional cell. It is also shown that a previously unsuspected intermediate step is thermodynamically favored in the well-known LiH + Li2NH ↔ Li3N + H2 reaction; this step involves the formation of Li4NH according to 2LiH + Li2NH ↔ Li4NH + H2.

 Abstract:  This paper describes a systematic study on the intercalation of an unstable chiral drug L-dopa into layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and the enhancement of its chemical and stereochemical stabilities through host-guest interactions, by virtue of combining experimental and theoretical investigations. L-Dopa has been intercalated into a magnesium-aluminum LDH, and the structural characterization reveals that L-dopa anions are accommodated vertically in the interlayer region as a monolayer of partially superimposed species. Thermogravimetry-mass spectroscopy and polarimetry indicate that both the chemical and stereochemical stabilities of L-dopa are enhanced significantly in a confined region between LDH sheets compared with pristine L-dopa. The racemization phenomenon of pristine L-dopa has been rationalized by quantum mechanical calculations at the B3PW91/6-31G(d,p) level. The computed results suggest that in the solid state L-dopa undergoes racemization via an enol intermediate formed by hydrogen transfer from the chiral carbon atom to the carboxylate group. After intercalation in the interlayer galleries of the LDH, the carboxylate group of the L-dopa becomes involved in strong host-guest interactions with the layers, with the computed binding energy of L-dopa to the LDH layers being ca. -1100 kJ/mol. The host-guest interactions, including electrostatic and hydrogen bonding between L-dopa and LDH host, thus inhibit the racemization reaction of the guest because the carboxylate group is no longer able to act as a hydrogen acceptor. Therefore, the results of theoretical study are in good agreement with those of the experimental ones.

 Abstract:  The thermodynamic and electronic properties of LixNa1-xMgH3 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75) have been investigated using the density functional theory within the generalized-gradient approximation. The obtained cohesive energies indicate that the stability of crystal increases with increasing Li element in LixNa1-xMgH3. The reaction enthalpies for LixNa1-xMgH3 phases have been investigated along four possible dehydrogenation reaction pathways, and the enthalpy change of two pathways is found to be nearly linearly reduced with increasing the Li substitution level from x = 0 to x = 0.75. The electronic densities of states show that with increasing Li substitution at Na sites in NaMgH3, the band gaps of the wide-band gap insulators LixNa1-xMgH3 become wider, and the contribution of Li s and p states to the total electronic densities of states become larger while Na s and p states become less. The obtained calculation results suggest that Li substitution in NaMgH3 may result in a favorable modification for onboard hydrogen storage application. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  A lithium salt of anionic scandium tetraborohydride complex, LiSc(BH 4) 4, was studied both experimentally and theoretically as a potential hydrogen storage medium. Ball milling mixtures of LiBH 4 and ScCl 3 produced LiCl and a unique crystalline hydride, which has been unequivocally identified via multinuclear solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to be LiSc(BH 4) 4. Under the present reaction conditions, there was no evidence for the formation of binary Sc(BH 4) 3. These observations are in agreement with our first-principles calculations of the relative stabilities of these phases. A tetragonal structure in space group I4̄ j (#82) is predicted to be the lowest energy state for LiSc(BH 4) 4, which does not correspond to structures obtained to date on the crystalline ternary borohydride phases made by ball milling. Perhaps reaction conditions are resulting in formation of other polymorphs, which should be investigated in future studies via neutron scattering on deuterides. Hydrogen desorption while heating these Li-Sc-B-H materials up to 400 °C yielded only amorphous phases (besides the virtually unchanged LiCl) that were determined by NMR to be primarily ScB 2 and [B 12H 12] -2 anion containing (e.g., Li 2B 12H 12) along with residual LiBH 4. Reaction of a desorbed LiSc(BH 4) 4 + 4LiCl mixture (from 4LiBH 4/ScCl 3 sample) with hydrogen gas at ̃70 bar resulted only in an increase in the contents of Li 2B 12H 12 and LiBH 4. Full reversibility to reform the LiSc(BH 4) 4 was not found. Overall, the Li-Sc-B-H system is not a favorable candidate for hydrogen storage applications. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

Alloy system Na1-xLixAlH4 is found to have a small mixing energy (<5 kJ/mol). The equilibrium structure undergoes a transition from a tetragonal structure to a monoclinic structure between x = 0.25 and 0.5. Within each structure the cell volume decreases with increasing x, which can be explained by Li having a smaller ion size than Na.

 Abstract:  Nb2O5 is known as good promoter for adsorption/desorption kinetics of hydrogen in magnesium hydride. In this article the interaction with hydrogen of bare Nb2O5, the oxidic component of the mixed MgH2/Nb2O5 system, is investigated in various conditions (i.e. employing atomic, molecular and nascent hydrogen). The state of the hydrogen-Nb2O5 system was monitored using various techniques including: X-ray Diffraction, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance, Diffuse Reflectance UV-Vis Spectroscopy, Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy -Mass Spectrometry, Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Thermal Programmed Desorption. Niobium (V) oxide is not at all inert while interacting with hydrogen. This oxide is partially reduced by hydrogen, which is incorporated in the solid and released as both molecular hydrogen and water. This peculiar behaviour, reminiscent of some properties of the bronze family, suggests an active chemical role played by Nb2O5 in the mixed MgH2/Nb2O5 system. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.

 Abstract:  The accuracy of gas phase sorption measurements performed on potential hydrogen storage materials has been the subject of much controversy in recent years, particularly in the case of adsorption by carbon nanostructures. As the technological interest in the solid state storage of hydrogen increases, it has become increasingly necessary to investigate the methods used to determine the sorption properties, and hence the storage capacities, of new and existing materials. In this paper, we briefly review the different techniques available and recent literature on the topic, discuss the possible sources of errors and present some comparative measurements on some AB5 hydrogen-absorbing intermetallics.

 Abstract:  Lithium tetrahydridoboranate (LiBH4) may be a potentially interesting material for hydrogen storage, but in order to absorb and desorb hydrogen routinely and reversibly, the kinetics and thermodynamics need to be improved significantly. A priori, this material has one of the highest theoretical gravimetric hydrogen contents, 18.5 wt %, but unfortunately for practical applications, hydrogen release occurs at too high temperature in a non-reversible way. By means of in situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD), the interaction between LiBH4 and different additives-SiO2, TiCl3, LiCl, and Au-is investigated. It is found that silicon dioxide reacts with molten LiBH4 and forms Li2SiO3 or Li4SiO4 at relatively low amounts of SiO2, e.g., with 5.0 and 9.9 mol % SiO2 in LiBH4, whereas, for higher amounts of SiO2 (e.g., 25.5 mol %), only the Li2SiO3 phase is observed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a solid-state reaction occurs between LiBH4 and TiCl3 to form LiCl at room temperature. At elevated temperatures, more LiCl is formed simultaneously with a decrease in the diffracted intensity from TiCl3. Lithium chloride shows some solubility in solid LiBH 4 at T > 100°C. This is the first report of substituents that accommodate the structure of LiBH4 by a solid/solid dissolution reaction. Gold is found to react with molten LiBH4 forming a Li-Au alloy with CuAu3-type structure. These studies demonstrate that molten LiBH4 has a high reactivity, and finding a catalyst for this H-rich system may be a challenge. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Erbium dihydride Er(H,D,T) 2 is a fluorite structure rare-earth dihydride useful for the storage of hydrogen isotopes in the solid state. However, thermodynamic predictions indicate that erbium oxide formation will proceed readily during processing, which may detrimentally contaminate Er(H,D,T) 2 films. In this work, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques including energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, energy-filtered TEM, selected area electron diffraction, and high-resolution TEM are used to examine the manifestation of oxygen contamination in ErD 2 thin films. An oxide layer ̃30-130 nm thick was found on top of the underlying ErD 2 film, and showed a cube-on-cube epitaxial orientation to the underlying ErD 2. Electron diffraction confirmed the oxide layer to be Er 2O 3. While the majority of the film was observed to have the expected fluorite structure for ErD 2, secondary diffraction spots suggested the possibility of either nanoscale oxide inclusions or hydrogen ordering. In situ heating experiments combined with electron diffraction ruled out the possibility of hydrogen ordering, so epitaxial oxide nanoinclusions within the ErD 2 matrix are hypothesized. TEM techniques were applied to examine this oxide nanoinclusion hypothesis. © 2009 Materials Research Society.

 Abstract:  Mechanical alloying of magnesium metal powders with hydrogen in specialized hydrogen ball mills can be used as a direct route for mechanochemical synthesis of emerging chemical hydrides and hydride mixtures for advanced solid-state hydrogen storage. In the 2Mg-Fe system, we have successfully synthesized the ternary complex hydride Mg2FeH6 in a mixture with nanometric Fe particles. The mixture of complex magnesium-iron hydride and nano-iron released 3-4 wt.%H2 in a thermally programmed desorption experiment at the range 285-295 °C. Milling of the Mg-2Al powder mixture revealed a strong competition between formation of the Al(Mg) solid solution and the β-MgH2 hydride. The former decomposes upon longer milling as the Mg atoms react with hydrogen to form the hydride phase, and drive the Al out of the solid solution. The mixture of magnesium dihydride and nano-aluminum released 2.1 wt.%H2 in the temperature range 329-340 °C in the differential scanning calorimetry experiment. The formation of MgH2 was suppressed in the Mg-B system; instead, a hydrogenated amorphous phase (Mg,B)Hx, was formed in a mixture with nanometric MgB2.

 Abstract:  New in situ Raman and synchrotron X-ray diffraction data (between 300 and 400 K) in conjunction with separate temperature-dependent Raman data (between 7 and 400 K) are presented. The low-frequency Raman spectra show good agreement with theoretical values obtained previously using periodic DFT calculations. The temperature-dependent spectra reveal the presence of significant anharmonicity of librational modes neither predicted theoretically nor noted in previous experiments. The splitting of the internal deformation mode 2 (of E symmetry in the free ion) decreases continuously with increasing temperature, but drops abruptly at the first-order orthorhombic to hexagonal phase transition observed at 381 K. The temperature dependence of the linewidth of the internal deformation mode 2 reveals coupling to reorientational motions of the borohydride ion in the orthorhombic phase. The thermal evolution of both crystal structure and vibration frequencies agree with the phase diagram suggested by the Landau theory.

 Abstract:  A closed-cycle gas-gap heat switch (GGHS) can function as a variable vacuum dewar for metal hydride compressors to reduce nominal input power to each compressor by ∼80% over its lifetime without the use of any moving parts. The hydrogen gas pressure in each GGHS is varied with an independent actuator containing ZrNi hydride. As the GGHS must attain low H2 gas pressure in its insulating ""off"" state to function reliably, any accumulation of additional gas in the GGHS can compromise the vacuum causing parasitic heat losses within the system. The effects of such accumulations have been found to be a combination of outgassing from metallic components and hydrogen permeation through the walls of the high-pressure compressor bed when it is heated between 290 K and 670 K. This accumulation has been volumetrically measured over a wide range of operating temperatures and pressures on different versions of hydride compressor beds to provide hydrogen accumulation rates in the GGHS.

 Abstract:  Application of poly(ethylene oxide)-based materials as efficient thermal energy storage systems requires understanding of structural and morphological issues that govern the thermal transitions of the blends. Poly(ethylene oxide)/lauric acid and poly(ethylene oxide)/stearic acid blends show high values of heat of melting and heat of crystallisation which exceed theoretically determined values - it is a synergistic effect that is advantageous in terms of energy storage. The PEO blends were investigated by PLM, SEM, AFM, WAXD, SAXS and 1H NMR techniques - PLM, SEM and AFM allows to observe regions, in which parallelly-packed crystals of fatty acid are present. WAXD results of PEO/fatty acid blends confirmed hindered crystallization of PEO in PEO/fatty acid blends and, finally, lower degree of polymer crystallinity. The NMR study shows that mixing of PEO and lauric acid results in an increase of PEO amorphous phase content in blends as compared to the pure PEO. From FTIR spectra, taken during melting and crystallization, it can be seen that for both investigated blends in the solid state there is only one maximum of band from ν(C{double bond, long}O) (in position indicating that C{double bond, long}O groups are engaged in formation of hydrogen bonds), while in the liquid state there are two maxima - position of the first maximum is characteristic for ν(C{double bond, long}O) vibrations of C{double bond, long}O groups that do not participate in formation of hydrogen bond, whereas position of the second maximum in the liquid state proves the presence of C{double bond, long}O groups involved in formation of hydrogen bonds.

 Abstract:  New silica-carbon adsorbents were prepared by pyrolysis of silica-polyamine composites at 600°C. The heat treatment was expected to activate nitrogen for effective hydrogen sulfide oxidation. Moreover, the same pyrolysis treatment was applied on silica-polyamine adsorbents previously used to remove copper ions for aqueous solution. The performance of these materials as H2S adsorbents was tested using a home-developed dynamic breakthrough test. Samples from before and after the adsorption process were characterized by adsorption of nitrogen, surface pH, thermal analysis, elemental analysis, FTIR, optical microscopy, and solid-state CPMAS 13C NMR. Differences in the performance were linked to the surface properties such as content of nitrogen, content of copper, surface acidity/basicity, and porous structure. It was found that the capacity for hydrogen sulfide removal/selectivity for oxidation to sulfur depends on the granulation of the silica matrix, the kind of polymer used for grafting, surface basicity, and porosity. Thermal transformation of the polymer causes the formation of new highly dispersed catalytic centers with active nitrogen atoms. The silica matrix also provides pore space for the storage of oxidation products, mainly elemental sulfur. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen adsorption in high surface area nanoporous coordination polymers has attracted a great deal of interest in recent years due to the potential applications in energy storage. Here we present combined inelastic neutron scattering measurements and detailed first-principles calculations aimed at unraveling the nature of hydrogen adsorption in HKUST-1 (Cu3(1,3,5- benzenetricarboxylate)2), a metal-organic framework (MOF) with unsaturated metal centers. We reveal that, in this system, the major contribution to the overall binding comes from the classical Coulomb interaction which is not screened due to the open metal site; this explains the relatively high binding energies and short H2-metal distances observed in MOFs with exposed metal sites as compared to traditional ones. Despite the short distances, there is no indication of an elongation of the H-H bond for the bound H2 molecule at the metal site. We find that both the phonon and rotational energy levels of the hydrogen molecule are closely similar, making the interpretation of the inelastic neutron scattering data difficult. Finally, we show that the orientation of H2 has a surprisingly large effect on the binding potential, reducing the classical binding energy by almost 30%. The implication of these results for the development of MOF materials for better hydrogen storage is discussed. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.

It is found from the first-principle calculation that the SiNT arrays exhibit much stronger attraction to hydrogen both inside and outside SiNTs, compared to the isodiameter carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The subsequent GCMC simulations indicate that the SiNT arrays present distinct improvements of 106%, 65%, and 52% in the gravimetric adsorption capacity of hydrogen at P = 2, 6, and 10 MPa, respectively, compared to the isodiameter CNTs. This suggests that the SiNT array is a promising candidate for hydrogen storage. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Experimental wet chemical approaches have been demonstrated in the synthesis of a new chainlike (C60-Fe-C60-Fe)n complex. This structure has been proposed based on 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, this structure has been shown to have unique binding sites for dihydrogen molecules with the technique of temperature-programmed desorption. The new adsorption sites have binding energies that are stronger than that observed for hydrogen physisorbed on planar graphite, but significantly weaker than a chemical C-H bond. Volumetric measurements at 77 K and 2 bar show a hydrogen adsorption capacity of 0.5 wt%. Interestingly, the BET surface area is ∼31 m 2/g after degassing, which is more than an order of magnitude less than expected given the measured experimental hydrogen capacity. Nitrogen and hydrogen isotherms performed at 75 K show a marked selectivity for hydrogen over nitrogen for this complex, indicating hidden surface area for hydrogen adsorption. Various LixC60 compounds have also been synthesized, inspired by theoretical predictions of an optimized Li 12C60 compound with substantial hydrogen capacity. Unfortunately, the theoretical structure was not experimentally achieved, nor was the predicted hydrogen capacity reached. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

 Abstract:  Combined synchrotron in situ X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction studies were performed on 2:1 mixtures of lithium amide and magnesium hydride, which have shown promise as solid-state hydrogen storage materials. The dehydrogenated product is a mixed lithium and magnesium imide, Li2Mg(NH)2, whose crystal structure has not heretofore been determined.

 Abstract:  In the search for novel hydrogen storage media, the III-V hydridic material [NH4] [BH4] is a natural candidate. It can store a high wt% of hydrogen and has a favorable volumetric density. Unfortunately it was found to decompose slowly at room temperature. It is of interest to consider chemically related materials, such as the series of [X H4] [Y H4] ionic solids (X=B, Al,Ga and Y=N, P,As). Even if the wt% of hydrogen in the heavier congeners is necessarily lower, they might offer superior material properties, notably higher (but not too high) stability. We have therefore performed a first-principles investigation of the cohesive energies of the X H4 Y H4 solid-state materials. In addition we have analyzed the bond character and energy within the building blocks of these materials, the X H4- and Y H4+ molecular ions, including a comparison to the A H4 molecules (A=C,Si,Ge). The calculations have been performed within the density functional framework employing plane waves for the bulk materials and Slater-type functions for the molecules. A detailed study of the electronic structure reveals that the hydrides of the light (second period) elements, BH4-, CH4, and NH4+, exhibit the strongest and shortest X-H bonds. This is caused by Pauli repulsion effects of the hydrogen substituents with the larger cores of the heavier (third and fourth period) elements. The important consequence is that in the crystals, where the ionic hydrides retain their identity and charge, the distance between the negative and positive ions is larger in the heavier systems, hence less Madelung stabilization and a smaller cohesive energy. Moving from [NH4] [BH4] to heavier congeners thus does not seem to be a promising route to obtain more suitable materials for hydrogen storage. Other types of chemical variation (different substituents) on the [NH4] [BH4] building blocks may prove more advantageous. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

 Abstract:  The long-term cyclic durability of nano-engineered solid-state hydrogen storage systems is investigated using LiNH2+LiH as a model system. Through 60 hydriding and dehydriding cycles over the course of more than 200 h, a small decrease in the kinetics of the dehydrogenation reaction leads to a 10% reduction in the amount of hydrogen liberated during a 2.5 h desorption. Although a 75% loss in the specific surface area is encountered within the first 10 cycles, the crystallite size remains relatively stable near 20 nm while enduring 72% of the average melting temperature of the phases. The lack of microstructural growth is attributed to low packing efficiency of the ball milled powder in combination with the mixture of multiple phases present and repeated nucleation of fine grains during hydriding and dehydriding reactions. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.

 Abstract:  Mechanochemistry means mechanical breakage of intramolecular bonds by external force and must be differentiated from molecular solid-state chemistry, where contacts between micronized molecular solids are created by the mechanical action for mutual approach of the reacting centers. After an outline of the mechanistic differences, the varied mechanochemistry is discussed. Grinding, milling, shearing, scratching, polishing, and rapid friction (for polymers also cutting, kneading, extruding) provide the mechanical impact for mechanochemistry, while sonication and shock waving for intramolecular bond breaking are generally described as thermal processes. The various types of mechanophysics (e.g., mechanoelectricity, conformational changes, thixotropy, rheopexy, stirring of Newtonian liquids or suspensions, etc.) are not treated here. Mechanochemistry covers solid-state reactions of infinitely covalent crystals, brittle metals, polymers, molecular solids with weak covalent bonds, strong intramolecular bond breakage in shearing Bridgman's anvil or by friction at lubrication of rapidly moving cold contacting surfaces, and single bond breaking or cutting. The diverse wealth of practical applications of mechanochemistry is outlined with typical examples for ceramics, mechanical alloying, hydrogen storage, organic syntheses, waste remediation, leachings, surface plasmas, radical formation, explosives, nanotube formation, nanoparticles grafting, polymer technology, radical initiation, scratch-less polishing, wear protection, lubrication, mechanochromism, nano-dissection, and many more. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

 Abstract:  Manganese borohydride (Mn(BH 4) 2) is considered to be a high-capacity (∼10 wt %) solid-state hydrogen storage candidate, but so far has not been shown to exhibit reversible hydrogenation. This study presents the calculated crystal structure and electronic structure of Mn(BH 4) 2 from density-functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation and thermodynamic properties from the direct method lattice dynamics. A thermodynamically stable phase of Mn(BH 4) 2 is identified. The calculation of Gibbs energy at finite temperatures suggests that the stable phase is of I4 jm2 symmetry. The formation energy of Mn(BH 4) 2 for the I4 j m2 symmetry solid is -28.93 kJ/f.u. at 0 K including zero-point energy corrections, and the standard state enthalpy of formation is predicted to be -58.89 kJ/f.u. The most feasible dehydrogenation reaction is found to be Mn(BH 4) 2 ) Mn + 2B+ 4H 2, which is an endothermic reaction at decomposition temperature. The spin-polarized electronic density of states shows that manganese borohydride has a half-metallic nature due to the presence of half-filled 3d electrons from Mn.

 Abstract:  Among the thermodynamic properties of novel materials for solid-state hydrogen storage, the heat of formation/decomposition of hydrides is the most important parameter to evaluate the stability of the compound and its temperature and pressure of operation. In this work, the desorption and absorption behaviors of three different classes of hydrides are investigated under different hydrogen pressures using high-pressure differential scanning calorimetry (HP-DSC). The HP-DSC technique is used to estimate the equilibrium pressures as a function of temperature, from which the heat of formation is derived. The relevance of this procedure is demonstrated for (i) magnesium-based compounds (Ni-doped MgH2), (ii) Mg-Co-based ternary hydrides (Mg-CoHx) and (iii) Alanate complex hydrides (Ti-doped NaAlH 4). From these results, it can be concluded that HP-DSC is a powerful tool to obtain a good approximation of the thermodynamic properties of hydride compounds by a simple and fast study of desorption and absorption properties under different pressures. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  This work focuses on the development of a new type of surface-relief grating (SRG) using more effective materials than a typical epoxy-based azopolymer for the recording layer of optical data storage. Thus, aniline-based azopolymers were synthesized by reaction of A/,A/-diglycidylaniline with aniline (An) followed by diazocoupling with 4-aminobenzonitrile or 4-nitroani- line. Such azopolymers when spin-cast from THF/diox- ane showed better diffraction efficiency than those cast from THF alone due to residual dioxane creating a large free volume in the solid state. A second di- azocoupling reaction of the diazopolymers initially obtained produced polymers with b/s(diazobenzene) substituents which exhibited a higher saturation level of the diffraction efficiency for a thicker than for a thinner film. Azopolymers in which the diazo substituents incorporated hydroxyl groups ortho to the diazo unit were obtained via the reaction of the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A with aniline or 3-hydroxyaniline followed by coupling with diazotised hydroxynitroaminobenzene. These hydroxy groups, presumably as a result of their H-bonding to the diazo-N, effectively prevented the photoisomerization of the chromophores, so that the polymers showed no SRG at a normal laser intensity of 100 mW/cm 2. Polyurethane-based azopolymers, synthesized with toluene-2,4-diisocyanate and disperse orange 17 containing no hydroxyl groups in the main chains, showed better diffraction efficiency than the other azopolymers with nitro group substituents. © 2009 Society of Plastics Engineers.

 Abstract:  Superiron cathodes, consisting of unusual Fe(VI) particles, are substantially stabilized with a low-level zirconia coating, which improves the experimental energy storage capacity of alkaline superiron batteries. Fe(VI) cathodes sustain three-electron alkaline reduction at a single, energetic [0.60 V vs standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)] potential. Superiron cathode salts such as K2 FeO4 and Cs2 FeO4 are stable in the solid state but tend to be passivated in alkaline electrolyte due to the formation of an Fe(III) overlayer. A zirconia coating is derived from ZrCl4 through an organic medium by the conversion of ZrCl4 to ZrO2. The zirconia coating shuttles hydroxide through to the interior cathode material, sustains a high rate of alkaline cathode charge transfer in the redox reduction of Fe(VI) to Fe(III) redox reduction, and inhibits Fe(III) passivation. The zirconia coating effectively enhances the stability of these superiron cathodes. However, for an Fe(VI) salt, which is not stable in the solid state, such as BaFeO2, an applied zirconia coating is not observed to stabilize alkaline cathodic charge transfer. Small particle and solid KOH and AgO additives each are observed to improve Fe(VI) cathodic charge transfer and enhance accessible Fe(VI) gravimetric capacity. © 2007 The Electrochemical Society.

 Abstract:  The hydrogen adsorption on alkaline-earth metal dispersed in doped graphenes was studied through ab initio calculations.

It was found that the adsorption behavior, particularly in Ca-dispersed graphene complexes, exhibits a crossover between the multipole Coulomb and Kubas-type (or orbital) interactions as the ionic state of Ca and the number of adsorbed hydrogen molecules change. The level exchange in s and d orbitals of Ca is responsible for the crossover.

 Abstract:  The thermal decomposition of ammonia borane (AB) in the absence and presence of chemical additives was investigated to develop an approach for reducing the induction period for hydrogen release in the solid state. Gas chromatography techniques were used to measure the yield of hydrogen as a function of time under isothermal conditions between 75 and 90 °C to set the baseline. Solid-state 11B-NMR spectroscopy of the products produced after 1 mol equiv of hydrogen had been desorbed from AB (i.e., polyaminoborane) showed a complex mixture of sp3 boron species. Raman microscopy was used to follow the transformation of crystalline AB to amorphous AB upon heating and the subsequent formation of the diammoniate of diborane (DADB). A gas buret was used to monitor the time-dependent release of hydrogen from AB in the presence of chemical additives. The combination of these approaches provides insight into the mechanism of hydrogen release from solid AB. The release of molecular hydrogen is described by a process involving sequential induction (disruption of dihydrogen bonds), nucleation (formation of DADB), and growth (hydrogen release through dehydrocoupling). Addition of DADB or ammonium chloride to neat AB significantly reduces the induction time for hydrogen release. These results provide approaches to improve the hydrogen storage properties of AB. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen storage in solid hydrides is the most attractive method of on-board hydrogen storage in fuel cell for cars.

 Abstract:  We have examined the effect of adding small quantities of Fe, Ni, and Zn, or their dichlorides, on the dehydrogenation temperature of the new quaternary hydride material LiB0.33N0.67H2.67. NiCl2 proved to be an especially effective dehydrogenation promoter. The hydrogen release temperature, represented by the temperature T1/2 at which the hydrogen release reaction is half completed, decreased by ΔT1/2 = -104 °C for 5 wt% NiCl2 addition and by ΔT1/2 = -112 °C for 11 wt% NiCl2 addition compared to that of additive-free LiB0.33N0.67H2.67. This represents a significant improvement over the maximum temperature reduction of ΔT1/2 = -90 °C achieved previously with Pt/Vulcan carbon additive (Pt nanoparticles supported on a Vulcan carbon substrate). Transmission electron microscopy on LiB0.33N0.67H2.67 + 11 wt% NiCl2 revealed uniformly dispersed nanoparticles with diameters less than 8 nm within the LiB0.33N0.67H2.67 matrix, consistent with reduction of the NiCl2 to metallic Ni during synthesis by ball milling. Mass spectrometry of the evolved gas showed that the total amount of NH3 released concurrently during dehydrogenation of LiB0.33N0.67H2.67 + 5 wt% NiCl2 was reduced by an order of magnitude compared to the additive-free material, and by a factor of four compared to LiB0.33N0.67H2.67 + 5 wt% Pt/Vulcan carbon. In contrast to additive-free LiB0.33N0.67H2.67, which melts completely above 190 °C and releases hydrogen from the liquid state only above about 250 °C, hydrogen release from LiB0.33N0.67H2.67 + 5 wt% NiCl2 is accompanied by partial melting above 190 °C plus transformation to a new, hydrogen-poor solid intermediate phase.

 Abstract:  Metal borohydrides have been attracting great interest as potential candidates for use as advanced hydrogen storage materials because of their high gravimetric hydrogen densities. In the present study, first-principles calculations have been performed for the newly reported dual-cation alkali metal borohydride LiK(BH4)2, using density functional theory (DFT) within the generalized gradient approximation and the projected augmented wave method. LiK(BH4)2 is found to have an orthorhombic structure in the space group Pnma (No 62) with nearly ideal tetrahedral shape. It is an insulating material having a DFT-calculated wide band gap of 6.08 eV. Analysis of the electronic structure shows an ionic interaction between metal cations and (BH4)- and the covalent B-H interaction within the (BH4)- tetrahedron. The enthalpy of the formation reaction from primary elements is calculated and found to be -449.8 kJ mol -1.

LiMgAlH6 is a stable intermediate, which has two competing endothermic decomposition pathways for H2 release: one going directly into the binary hydrides of Li and Mg and the other proceeding via the formation of an intermediate Li3 AlH6 phase, with room-temperature enthalpies of +18.6 and +16.6 kJ/ (mol H2), respectively. Using database searching based on known crystal structures from the inorganic crystal structure database, we predict that the hypothetical MgAlH5 compound should assume the orthorhombic BaGaF5 prototype structure, in contrast to a previous DFT study of MgAlH5,. However, the decomposition enthalpy of MgAlH5 is only weakly endothermic, +1.1 kJ/ (mol H2), and therefore this compound is not expected to occur in the high-temperature decomposition sequence of Mg alanate. We also present a comprehensive investigation of the phonon spectra and vibrational thermodynamics of Li-Mg-Al-H compounds, finding that vibrations typically decrease reaction enthalpies by up to 10 kJ/mol H2 at ambient temperatures and significantly lower reaction entropies. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

 Abstract:  From first-principles density functional electronic structure calculations, we show that Si60H60) forms a highly symmetric (meta)stable fullerene structure on which Ti atoms can be capped exohedrally in cationic form, enabling storage of hydrogen in the molecular state. Whereas the H atoms on a Si60H60) cage saturate the Si dangling bonds, the Ti+ ion sitting on the energetically favorable hexagonal face of the Si60H60 fullerene allows a maximum of four H 2 molecules to be attached, with a binding energy intermediate between those of physisorption and chemisorption. However, two Ti atoms added to Si fullerene tend to dimerize, thereby reducing the hydrogen-storage efficiency. This clustering tendency of the Ti atoms on the fullerene surface can be avoided by doping the fullerene with P atoms. Our first-principles results show that Ti-decorated P10Si50H50 clusters can serve as a potential hydrogen-storage material, with a storage capacity of up to 5.23 wt % corresponding to full Ti coverage. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  We synthesized BNnanoCHx by ball-milling hBN under methane atmosphere. This BNnanoCHx product itself desorbed not only hydrogen but also hydrocarbons in a wide temperature range from 300 to 900 °C. Moreover, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy for BNnanoCHx indicated the existence of the C-H bonding in the material. On the analogy of the CnanoHx-LiH composite reported before, we prepared the composite of BNnanoCHx and LiH. This composite successfully desorbed hydrogen around 200 °C, in which the emission of the hydrocarbon gases was strongly suppressed. Thermodynamic and structural properties of the composite showed an interaction between the C-H groups and LiH. Thus we found that the BNnanoCHx-LiH composite is a new hydrogen storage material. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  Lightweight complex hydrides have attracted attention for their high storage hydrogen capacity. NaAlH4 has been widely studied as a hydrogen storage material for its favorable reversible operating temperature and pressure range for automotive fuel cell applications. The increased understanding of NaAlH4 has led to an expanded search for high capacity materials in mixed alkali and akali/alkaline earth alanates. In this study, promising candidates in the Na-Li-Mg-Al-H system were evaluated using a combination of experimental chemistry, atomic modeling, and thermodynamic modeling.

 Abstract:  The solid-state reaction between LiNH2 and LiH potentially offers an effective route for hydrogen storage if it can be tailored to meet all the requirements for practical applications. To date, there still exists large uncertainty on the mechanism of the reaction-whether it is mediated by a transient NH3 or directly between LiNH2 and LiH. In an effort to clarify this issue and improve the reactivity, the effects of selected nitrides were investigated here by temperature-programmed desorption, X-ray diffraction, in-situ infrared analysis, and hydrogen titration. The results show that the reaction of LiNH2 with LiH below 300°C is a heterogeneous solid-state reaction controlled by Li+ diffusion from LiH to LiNH2 across the interface. At the LiNH2/LiH interface, an ammonium ion Li2NH2+ and a penta-coordinated nitrogen Li2NH3 could be the intermediate states leading to the production of hydrogen and the formation of lithium imide. In addition, it is identified that BN is an efficient ""catalyst"" that improves Li+ diffusion and hence the kinetics of the reaction between LiNH2 and LiH. Hydrogen is fully released within 7 h at 200°C with BN addition, rather than several days without the modification. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  A magnetron sputtered thin films of the AZ31 alloy and AZ31 alloy with Ti capped with Pd were electrochemically hydrogenated and dehydrogenated in a 3 M KOH solution. A phase composition and structure of the films were studied by XRD. It has been determined that the behaviour of magnetron sputtered alloy AZ31 during electrochemical charging with hydrogen was alike that of pure Mg. The shift of the XRD peak Mg (0 0 0 2) to lower angles indicates that a hydrogen solid solution in the AZ31 alloy was formed along with MgH2. When the AZ31 alloy with 18 at.% of Ti was electrochemically hydrogenated the whole film was transformed into hydride. The minor part of the hydride was in the nanocrystalline state with a structure of rutile and a major part of the hydride was in the amorphous state. After dehydrogenation only a part of the alloy recovered and the rest remained in the state of amorphous hydride. A positive shift of peak Pd (1 1 1) was observed in all of the XRD patterns for hydrogenated films. At least partially the shift should be associated with the compressive stresses in the top-cap layer of Pd, which arose due to the hydrogenation of the AZ31 alloy. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Metal hydrides hold significant potential for use in solidstate hydrogen storage through reversible chemical reactions of metal constituents and hydrogen. Managing heat loads in the system is critical to controlling system performance because a substantial amount of the energy content in hydrogen gas is released during the exothermic hydrogen uptake process, and this process must occur in only a few minutes for vehicle applications. These materials often are used in a powder form in which the initial particle size is 50-100 micrometers. However, as the material is cycled by hydriding (M+H 2→MH) and dehydriding (M+H 2←MH), particle size can decrease by several orders of magnitude. For the solid metal hydride phase, relative contributions of the electronic and phononic thermal conductivities are quantified with varying composition and particle size. Particle size effects are approximated by a boundary scattering term in the phononic thermal conductivity formulation. Also, the electronic contribution to thermal conductivity is estimated as a function of hydrogen content. The results reveal that overall thermal conductivity is highly material-specific. Materials with large electronic contributions in the pure metal state are relatively unaffected by particle size, while those with lower electronic contributions exhibit a substantial decrease in thermal conductivity with particle size.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen bonding in solids has provided diverse attractive issues. Prof. C. N. R. Rao and his collaborators have made representative achievements on experimental and theoretical grounds as well as on the resultant crystal engineering and functionalities. Many of the key issues clarified in those extensive studies are valid in our investigations on ferroelectricity of hydrogen-bonded supramolecules, linear chain cocrystals of phenazine (Phz) with anilic acids (H2xa). Ferroelectrics have a spontaneous polarization that is switchable by an applied electric field, and have long constituted numerous technological applications such as capacitors, sensors, and information storage devices. In this paper, we overview the dielectric, ferroelectric, structural, and optical properties of such a family of hydrogen-bonded cocrystals as complemented with some latest advances to disclose the key experimental findings. Excellent ferroelectric properties are highlighted by the large response under small electric field in spite of the use of originally neutral and nonpolar constituents. The ferroelectric phase transition asymmetrically elongates an O-H bond with the strengthened O-H⋯N intermolecular bond. This mechanism is distinct from the site-to-site collective transfer of protons observed in conventional ferroelectrics like KH 2PO4 (KDP). Rather, it represents quite an exotic proton displacement, being an incipient phenomenon of the transition from the neutral to the monovalent ionic form. Furthermore, the lower temperature regions find successive phase transitions to an additional ferroelectric phase having a doubled or threefold supercell. Periodic proton ordering is proposed as a possible picture of this ground state. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009.

 Abstract:  The objective of this study was to assess effects of some clinically related preparation procedures during tooth whitening on enamel bonding properties. Sixty-two extracted human teeth were cleaned and divided into four groups. Forty-two of the teeth were left with their natural surface intact while 20 teeth were polished to form a flat surface. Half of the tooth served as the experimental side and received one of the two whitening products: Opalescence (10% carbamide peroxide) and Crest Whitestrips (6.5% hydrogen peroxide), for 2 weeks. Post-bleaching intervals included: 1 day, 1 week, and 2 weeks. On these days, tooth (10 mm × 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm) sections were evaluated using Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and tensile bond strength tests. T-test, ANOVA test, and mixed model regression analysis were used to assess the differences. No significant difference existed between natural surface and polished surface teeth for all groups at both Day One and Week Two (P > 0.05). On Day One, both treated groups had significant lower bond strength than the control group (P = 0.002). After 2 weeks, no significant difference existed between any group (P = 0.381). SEM indicated that resin-enamel interfaces in bleached enamel exhibited more defects in granular formations when compared to the control. Raman results indicated a lower degree of polymerization (DP) of adhesive at the interface for treated teeth surfaces. In summary, pre-bleaching surface treatments such as polish or non-polish, had no effect on bond strength. Bleaching significantly decreased bond strength initially, but after 2 weeks, bleaching had no significant effect on bond strength. Storage time had significant effect on Opalescence treated enamel, but not on control and Whitestrip treated enamel. The decrease of bond strength may be related to interfacial defects and low DP due to oxygen release after bleaching. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

 Abstract:  In an exploratory search for new oxygen storage materials (OSMs), we have identified a fluorite-type solid solution series, Ce1-xCr xO2+y (0 < x ≤ 1/3), of which the x = 1/3 member, Ce2/3Cr1/3O2.11 (oxide I), exhibits excellent reversible oxygen release/storage properties at relatively low temperatures (∼350 °C). Oxide I prepared by a hydrothermal route crystallizes in a metastable nanocrystalline (∼4 nm) fluorite type structure (a = 5.352 Å) where the cerium and chromium are randomly distributed. Characterization of oxide I by electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetry for the composition, crystal structure, oxidation states of metal atoms, and oxygen stoichiometry yields the formula CeIV2/3CrVI 1/9CrIV2/9O2.10 ± 0.02 for oxide I. Investigation of oxygen release/intake by temperature programmed hydrogen reduction and thermogravimetric studies has revealed that oxide I possesses a high oxygen storage capacity of 0.175 moles of O2/mole up to 550 °C; this value is better than or comparable to the best OSMs based on CeO2-ZrO2. The temperature (∼350°C) at which facile oxygen release/intake occurs with oxide I is also lower than that of CeO2-ZrO2 based oxides. Formation of oxide I with a cation-disordered fluorite structure, unlike other lanthanide analogs, and its oxygen release/storage properties are discussed in terms of the redox chemistry of CeIV/ m and CrVI/IV in the solid state. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  Ball milling of MgCl2 and CaCl2 with NaAlH 4 or LiAlH4 can be used for the preparation of magnesium, calcium and lithium-magnesium alanates in mixture with NaCl or LiCl. Using wet chemical separation methods, it was possible to obtain these alanates in nearly pure state. The alanates were characterized by X-ray diffractometry, solid-state 27Al NMR and IR spectroscopy and thermovolumetric (TV) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. Mg(AlH4) 2 dissociates thermally in one step to MgH2, Al and hydrogen; at a higher temperature, MgH2 and Al transform to Mg-Al alloy and hydrogen. Thermal dissociations of Ca(AlH4)2 and of LiMg(AlH4)3 (in mixture with NaCl or LiCl) proceeds in several steps, of which the first two can be assigned to the formation of CaH2 and of a MgH2/LiH mixture, respectively, in addition to Al and H2. Possible intermediates of these two steps are CaAlH5 and LiMgAlH6. Higher temperature dissociations include formation of MgH2 (LiH) and Ca-Al alloys from CaH 2, CaH2 and Al, respectively. Upon ball milling of MgCl2 or CaCl2 with NaAlH4 or LiAlH4 in the presence of Ti catalysts, only the thermal dissociation products of the expected alanates are obtained. This indicates that dehydrogenation discharge of earth alkali metal alanates can be catalyzed by Ti. According to DSC measurements, the thermodynamic stability of Mg(AlH4)2 (ΔH = 1.7 kJ/mol) is too low for the purpose of reversible hydrogen storage. Determination of ΔH values for the second, endothermal step of calcium and lithium-magnesium alanate dissociations gave values of around 31.6 and 13.1 kJ/mol, respectively. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy's (FE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), in partnership with private industries, is leading the development and demonstration of high efficiency solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and fuel cell turbine hybrid power generation systems for near term distributed generation (DG) market with emphasis on premium power and high reliability. NETL is partnering with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in developing new directions in research under the Solid-State Energy Conversion Alliance (SECA) initiative for the development and commercialization of modular, low cost, and fuel flexible SOFC systems. The SECA initiative, through advanced materials, processing and system integration research and development will bring the fuel cell cost to $400/kilowatt (kW) for stationary and auxiliary power unit (APU) markets. The President of the U.S. has launched us into a new hydrogen economy. The logic of a hydrogen economy is compelling. The movement to a hydrogen economy will accomplish several strategic goals. The U.S. can use its own domestic resources - solar, wind, hydro, and coal. The U.S. uses 20 percent oil but has only 3 percent of resources. Also, the U.S. can reduce green house gas emissions. Clear Skies and Climate Change aim to reduce CO 2, NOx, and SO 2 emissions. SOFC's have no emissions so they figure significantly in these DOE strategies. In addition, DG - SOFC's, reforming, energy storage - has significant benefit for enhanced security and reliability. The use of fuel cells is expected to bring about the hydrogen economy. However, commercialization of fuel cells is expected to proceed first through portable and stationary applications. This logic says to develop SOFC's for a wide range of stationary and APU applications, initially for conventional fuels, then switch to hydrogen. Like all fuel cells the SOFC will operate even better on hydrogen than conventional fuels. The SOFC hybrid is a key part of the FutureGen plants. FutureGen is a major new Presidential initiative to produce hydrogen from coal. The highly efficient SOFC hybrid plant will produce electric power and other parts of the plant could produce hydrogen and sequester CO 2. The hydrogen produced can be used in fuel cell cars and for SOFC DG applications. This U.S. DOE fuel cell funding shown in Figure 1 is only for SOFC. If other U.S. agencies, Japanese, European, and industry cost share, SOFC funding is around $100 MM/year. The DOE FE SECA budget has shown strong growth since a small amount of funds were allocated for initial work in 2000. The SECA program has grown as earlier programs ended.

 Abstract:  The compound NaAlH4 has been proposed as a viable hydrogen storage media capable of supplying hydrogen at moderate temperatures and at rates required for fuel cell applications. A number of researchers have subsequently verified and enhanced the rate of dehydrogenation in this system using combined transition metal catalytic additions along with different methods of their introduction into the NaAlH4 compound. The most potent catalytic addition identified thus far is TiCl3 added through ball milling, however, ZrCl3 and other transition metal chlorides have also been found useful. To this date, the role of the catalysts are still unknown as well as their disposition within the NaAlH4 compound. This investigation has sought to identify the extent catalytic dehydrogenation reaction rate of a number of transition metal additions to NaAlH4 at 120°C. Two mol% catalysts were added, primarily as chlorides, in a number of valance states. High energy ball mill attrition of the catalyst and the alanate were made with optimum milling times determined. Comparison of dehydrogenation rates with ion radius has shown an optimum catalyst ion radius ratio to be readily identifiable as being midway between that of Al(III) and Na(I).

This investigation implies that partial cation substitutions using smaller sized- and/or higher valenced-cations with higher electronegativities might provide higher energy modes of Raman spectra, and then, lower hydrogen desorption temperatures. Next, as an example, LiNH2 and its partial cation substitution materials are examined. At the start of the reaction, the hydrogen desorption temperature for LiNH2 with partial cation substitution drastically decreased, with the increase in Mg concentration, to around 370K for the sample with x = 30. © 2005 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

 Abstract:  Experimental wet chemical approaches to complex an iron atom with two C60 fullerenes, representing a new molecule, dubbed a ""bucky dumbbell,"" have been demonstrated. The structure of this molecule has been determined by 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic spin resonance (EPR). Furthermore, this structure has been shown to have a unique binding site for dihydrogen molecules with the technique of temperature programmed desorption (TPD). The new adsorption site has a binding energy that is stronger than that observed for hydrogen physisorbed on planar graphite, but significantly weaker than a chemical C-H bond. These results indicate that further exploration of fullerene-based organometallic complexes could lead to a revolutionary discovery for onboard vehicular hydrogen storage. © 2006 Materials Research Society.

 Abstract:  Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance is used to study the thermal decomposition of lithium tetrahydroaluminate into metallic aluminum, hydrogen and trilithium hexahydroaluminate. Aluminum sites in LiAlH4 and Li3AlH6 were characterized using static, magic angle spinning (MAS) and multiple-quantum MAS NMR. By applying the in situ NMR method, it has been demonstrated that melting is not a prerequisite for the decomposition of LiAlH4. Based on the observed data, a decomposition path has been established that is consistent with the concentrations of observed Al species at various stages of the thermally induced reaction.

 Abstract:  Mg2Co was successfully synthesized by the solid-state reaction from Mg and Co powder mixture via bulk mechanical alloying (BMA) and annealing. The sample was analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). Hydrogen absorption and desorption behavior was described by pressure-compositionisotherms (PCT). In the temperature range of 633K there are two plateau pressures in the pressure region of 0.6~3MPa in the absorption isotherms and only one plateau pressure in the desorption isotherms.

 Abstract:  Mg-Co and Mg-Fe systems were employed as a candidate hydrogen storage alloy. Different from Mg-Ni system, there exist no line compounds of Mg2Co and Mg2Fe. Non-equilibration of these compounds is indispensable to make solid state synthesis. Bulk mechanical alloying was applied to this non-equilibration of Mg2Co with success. Planetary ball milling was also utilized to discuss the process efficiency of bulk mechanical alloying. In particular, the on-line monitored energy density was used to describe the homogeneous refining and solid-state reaction with increasing the number of cycles. Through SEM observation of intermediate phase change, the solid-state reaction commences when the total energy density exceeds the critical limit. SEM/EDX and XRD analyses assured that the synthesized non-equilibrium phase should be Mg2Co. The Goldschmidt-factor analysis was used to determine that the synthesized Mg2Co has mainly fcc-structure. No significant change of XRD profiles was observed even when increasing the holding temperature. This Mg2Co is quasi-stable, non-equilibrium phase even at the elevated temperature. In case of Mg-Fe system, the initial elemental particle mixture was homogeneously refined. Under the similar condition to the solid-state synthesis of Mg2Co, however, Mg2Fe was not synthesized even via bulk mechanical alloying. Through precise analysis, non-equilibrium phase with high iron content was recognized, so that non-equilibration via the bulk mechanical alloying might well be effective to investigate the solid state synthesis of binary compounds even in Mg-Fe system.

 Abstract:  Based on theories of hydrogen electrode reactions at the palladium surface and self-stresses of hydrogen in thin tubular shells established earlier, we numerically calculate transport properties of hydrogen across a tubular membrane under galvanostatic charging conditions. It is found that the exited hydrogen flux is much less than the charging current since the hydrogen combination reaction takes place at the outer surface. On the other hand, the overall system is in an unstable state after a long time charging; this makes the determination of hydrogen diffusivity difficult in experiments. The theoretical results are in good agreement with experimental data obtained before. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  Electrical vehicles (EV) powered by a fuel cell will need a buffer tank to supply hydrogen especially for cold start and/or to overcome the delayed response time in the hydrogen supply system (reformer, dehydrogenation, etc.). To allow hydrogen supply at low temperature, the crystallographic and thermodynamic properties of the system La0.55Y0.45Ni 5-H2 have been investigated. The pressure-composition-isotherm (PCI) curves have been carried out between 253 and 318 K. The compound La 0.55Y0.45Ni5 can deliver 5.4 H/f.u. (1.3 wt.%) under 0.35 MPa at 253 K. At room temperature, between 0.6 and 3.3 H/f.u., a well-defined plateau is observed in the PCI curve. However, for capacity values larger than 3.3 H/f.u., a step is observed followed by a sloppy domain. Investigation by neutron diffraction at various states of charge has allowed determination of the La0.55Y0.45Ni5-D2 phase diagram. The existence of an intermediate γ phase has been established. The crystal structures of the α,γ and β phases have been determined. The occurrence of the γ phase could significantly increase the cycle life of the hydride by decreasing the constraints which are generated during absorption/desorption cycling as previously observed in other LaNi 5-type systems. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  The lack of suitable means of storing hydrogen for use in the transport sector is generally viewed as a primary showstopper for a hydrogen economy. Recent developments within solid state hydrogen storage in complex hydrides and metal ammines have sparked new hope of a long term solution, but as of now, no materials fulfill all the DoE targets for onboard storage [1]. A detailed physical understanding of the ab-/desorption processes and the role of the essential catalytic additives is an essential prerequisite for the development of new optimized hydrogen storage systems. Here, we illustrate the potential of utilizing the synergy of combining state-of-the-art in theoretical methods and experimental techniques in the analysis and design of materials for hydrogen storage. Recent advances in computer hard- and software has made it possible to treat many of the essential problems in such materials, i.e. structural stability, hydrogen dissociation and diffusion, with high accuracy methods like density functional theory. We rely on such results to guide our synthesis of new materials, and to interpret our experimental results from, e.g. time dependant in situ x-ray diffraction, synchrotron/neutron experiments, and advanced materials testing. Through a continuous feed-back optimization loop between theory and experiments, the obtained nano-scale insight is used to expedite the design and development of novel materials for hydrogen storage.

 Abstract:  The most common diagnostic tools in studying reversible solid-state hydrogen storage materials involve volumetric or gravimetric approaches. In this study, a mature gas solid analysis technique called Temperature Programmed Reaction (TPR) is presented as an alternative and complementary approach in investigating solid-state hydrogen storage materials. TPR is fast, simple and offers valuable information from a wide range of solid materials. This technique is routinely used to characterize the reduction behavior of metal oxide and sulfide catalysts. In a typical TPR experiment, a sample powder is heated at a constant rate under a non steady-state environment of constant pressure and flow of a hydrogen/inert gas mixture, while monitoring the rate of hydrogen absorption and desorption by a thermal conductivity detector. The principle behind TPR is the high thermal conductivity coefficient of hydrogen when compared to other gases. The detector is sensitive enough that a slight change in hydrogen concentration is reflected by significant changes in the thermal conductivity signal. Hydrogen storage materials exhibit fingerprint type TPR spectra, unique to their composition and structure. Specific rates of hydrogen intake, heats of absorption and desorption as well as extent of activation can be extracted from TPR curves. In addition, multiple absorption and desorption states can be identified from the number of absorption or desorption peaks. Material stability and potential structural or phase changes can also be inferred indirectly. The simplicity and the highly sensitive thermal conductivity measurement provide a number of advantages over the traditional volumetric or gravimetric methods. Metal hydride alloys of AB5-type are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of TPR technique in characterizing hydrogen storage materials.

 Abstract:  The nature of strontium binding by soil minerals directly affects the transport and sequestration/remediation of radioactive strontium species released from leaking high-level nuclear waste storage tanks. However, the molecular-level structure of strontium binding sites has seldom been explored in phyllosilicate minerals by direct spectroscopic means and is not well-understood. In this work, we use solid-state NMR to analyze strontium directly and indirectly in a fully strontium-exchanged synthetic mica of nominal composition Na4Mg6Al4Si4O 20F4. Thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis, and NMR evidence supports that heat treatment at 500°C for 4 h fully dehydrates the mica, creating a hydrogen-free interlayer. Analysis of the strontium NMR spectrum of the heat-treated mica shows a single strontium environment with a quadrupolar coupling constant of 9.02 MHz and a quadrupolar asymmetry parameter of 1.0. These quadrupolar parameters are consistent with a highly distorted and asymmetric coordination environment that would be produced by strontium cations without water in the coordination sphere bound deep within the ditrigonal holes. Evidence for at least one additional strontium environment, where proton - strontium couplings may occur, was found via a 1H-87Sr transfer of populations by double resonance NMR experiment. We conclude that the strontium cations in the proton-free interlayer are observable by 87Sr NMR and bound through electrostatic interactions as nine coordinate inner-sphere complexes sitting in the ditrigonal holes. Partially hydrated strontium cations invisible to direct 87Sr NMR are also present and located on the external mica surfaces, which are known to hydrate upon exposure to atmospheric moisture. These results demonstrate that modern pulsed NMR techniques and high fields can be used effectively to provide structural details of strontium binding by phyllosilicate minerals. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  In recent years, the development of Ti-doped NaAlH4 as a hydrogen storage material has gained attention because of its large weight percentage of hydrogen (∼5 %) compared to traditional interstitial hydrides. The addition of transition-metal dopants, in the form of Ti-halides, such as TiCl3, dramatically improves the kinetics of the absorption and desorption of hydrogen from NaAlH4. However, the role that Ti plays in enhancing the absorption and desorption of H2 is still unknown. In the present study, 27Al, 23Na, and 1H MAS (Magic Angle Spinning) NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) has been performed to understand the titanium speciation in Ti-doped NaAlH4. All experiments were performed on a sample of crushed single crystals exposed to Ti during growth, a sample of solvent-mixed 4TiCl3 + 112NaAlH 4, a reacted sample of solvent-mixed TiCl3 + 3NaAlH 4 with THF, and a reacted sample of ball-milled TiCl3 + 3NaAlH4. The 27Al MAS NMR has shown differences in compound formation between solvent-mixed TiCl3 + 3NaAlH4 with THF and the ball-milled TiCl3 + 3NaAlH4. 27Al MAS NMR of the ball-milled mixture of fully-reacted TiCl 3 + 3NaAlH4 showed spectral signatures of TiAl3 while, the solvent-mixed 4TiCl3 + 112NaAlH4, which is totally reacted, does not show the presence of TiAl3, but suggests the existence of Al2O3.

 Abstract:  The effect of sequential and continuous high-energy impact mode in the magneto-mill Uni-Ball-Mill 5 on the mechano-chemical synthesis of nanostructured ternary complex hydride Mg2FeH6 was studied by controlled reactive mechanical alloying (CRMA). In the sequential mode the milling vial was periodically opened under a protective gas and samples of the milled powder were extracted for microstructural examination whereas during continuous CRMA the vial was never opened up to 270 h duration. MgO was detected by XRD in sequentially milled powders while no MgO was detected in the continuously milled powder. The abundance of the nanostructured ternary complex hydride Mg 2FeH6, produced during sequential milling, and estimated from DSC reached ∼44 wt.% after 188 h, and afterwards it slightly decreased to ∼42 wt.% after 210 and 270 h. In contrast, the DSC yield of Mg 2FeH6 after continuous CRMA for 270 h was ∼57 wt.%. Much higher yield after continuous milling is attributed to the absence of MgO. This behavior provides strong evidence that MgO is a primary factor suppressing formation of Mg2FeH6. The DSC hydrogen desorption onset temperatures are close to 200 °C while the desorption peak temperatures for all powders are below 300 °C and the desorption process is completed within the range 10-20 min. Within the investigated nanograin size range of ∼5-13 nm, the DSC desorption onset and peak temperatures of β-MgH2 and Mg2FeH6 do not exhibit any trend with nanograin (crystallite) size of hydrides. TPD hydrogen desorption peaks from the powders containing a single ternary complex hydride Mg2FeH6, are very narrow, which indicates the presence of small but well-crystallized hydride particles. Their narrowness provides good evidence that the phase composition, bulk hydrogen distribution and hydride particle size distribution are very homogeneous. The overall amount of hydrogen desorbed in TPD from single-hydride Mg2FeH6 powders is somewhat higher than that observed in DSC and TGA desorption. The powder milled sequentially for 270 h and desorbed in a Sieverts-type apparatus at 250 and 290 °C, yielded about a half of the hydrogen content obtained during DSC and TGA tests. No desorption of hydrogen was detected in a Sieverts-type apparatus at 250 and 290 °C after 128 and 70 min, respectively, from the powder continuously milled for 270 h. The latter easily desorbed 3.13 and 2.83 wt.% hydrogen in DSC and TGA tests, respectively. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  There is great interest in metal-hydrogen systems. When small amounts of hydrogen are absorbed by elemental metals and alloys, the engineering materials made of the systems exhibit strong changes in their physical and mechanical properties. These changes, and hydrogen embrittlement, can be considered detrimental to the structural performance of the materials. However, the changes, often studied by metallurgists and metal physicists, can present new possibilities and applications. An example is the interest in safe, solid-state hydrogen storage in metallic lattices. The effect of elasto-plastic deformation on hydrogen sorption in light metals and hydrides has been studied in an MTL project. It has been observed that high-rate impacting of pure magnesium has an effect on hydrogen storage capacity. Furthermore, analysis of the state of residual stress performed by X-ray diffraction method for the first time in such high-rate, milled materials, indicates a very complex stress distribution dependent on the time of milling. The milling in increments of 10 minutes from 0, original un-milled material, to 30 minutes, indicates extensive changes in the stress states.

 Abstract:  The generation of metal-organic framework (MOF) coordination polymers enables the tailoring of novel solids with regular porosity from the micro to nanopore scale. Since the discovery of this new family of nanoporous materials and the concept of so called 'reticular design', nowadays several hundred different types of MOF are known. The self assembly of metal ions, which act as coordination centres, linked together with a variety of polyatomic organic bridging ligands, results in tailorable nanoporous host materials as robust solids with high thermal and mechanical stability. Describing examples of different zinc-containing structures, e.g. MOF-2, MOF-5 and IRMOF-8 verified synthesis methods will be given, as well as a totally novel electrochemical approach for transition metal based MOFs will be presented for the first time. With sufficient amounts of sample now being available, the testing of metal-organic frameworks in fields of catalysis and gas processing is exemplified. Report is given on the catalytic activation of alkynes (formation of methoxypropene from propyne, vinylester synthesis from acetylene). Removal of impurities in natural gas (traces of tetrahydrothiophene in methane), pressure swing separation of rare gases (krypton and xenon) and storage of hydrogen (3.3 wt% at 2.0 MPa/77 K on Cu-BTC-MOF) will underline the prospective future industrial use of metal-organic frameworks in gas processing.

 Abstract:  The difficulties in the use of carbon paste electrodes to quantify the electrochemical adsorption of hydrogen in nanocarbon materials are described. Chronoamperometry studies using a Ferro/Ferri redox couple were performed to obtain the electrochemical active area of paste electrodes prepared by dispersion of differing samples of carbon blacks (CB) within silicon oil. This electrochemical active area was combined with the BET-surface area of the carbon blacks, to obtain the mass of superficial carbon involved in the electrochemical processes. To assure equal conditions for comparison, the electronic conductivity of the paste was equivalent in all the samples. From our results it appears that cyclic voltammetry, combined with carbon paste electrodes and nitrogen adsorption isotherms, provides a simple and less expensive route for the qualitative evaluation of the electrochemical hydrogen uptake of novel carbon materials. Still, for quantitative measurements, some issues remain unsolved in highly structured carbons, where the lack of penetration of the bulky Ferro/Ferri redox couple in the micropores of the CB and the occurrence of solid-state diffusion cause the underestimation of the mass involved in hydrogen adsorption. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

 Abstract:  Considerable effort has been devoted to the Li-N-H system for solid-state hydrogen storage. However, the desorption mechanism is still unclear, the desorption kinetics is too low, and the desorption temperature is too high for practical considerations. Here, the characteristics of LiNH2 and a (LiNH2 + LiH) mixture were comparatively studied by simultaneous thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry and mass spectrometry for further understanding of H2 desorption in the (LiNH2 + LiH) system. Both mechanical milling and chemical addition were noted to influence the decomposition kinetics of LiNH2. Mass spectrometry and thermal analysis of (LiNH2 + LiH) mixtures indicate that approximately 5 mass% of H2 is released after 4 h of milling without any apparent release of NH3, whereas insufficient mixing of the two compounds cannot stop the release of NH3 from the mixture. Chemical additions, Mn, V, MnO2 and V2O5, promote the thermal decomposition of LiNH2, but show insignificant effect on hydrogen desorption of the (LiNH2 + LiH) mixture. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  In recent years anelastic spcctroscopy has been successfully employed in the study of hydrogen dynamics in promising materials for solid state hydrogen storage. In Ti-doped and undoped sodium alanates anelastic spectroscopy measurements showed the formation of a very mobile species during their decomposition reactions. This species gives rise to a thermally activated relaxation peak with an activation energy of 0.126 eV and a precxponcntial factor of 7×10 -14 s, which is typical of point-defect relaxation. Various possible sources of the process have been considered, taking into account the products of decomposition. After excluding even the involvement of catalytic Ti, the most likely cause of the observed process is a hexahydride stoichiometry defect of type AlH x (x<6) missing one or more H atoms, thus giving rise to local vacancy dynamics. The results show that not all the hydrogen released during the high temperature decomposition reactions evolves out of the samples as gas, but part of it remains in the lattice and distributes itself between the Ti trapping sites and the free interstitial sites. The hydrogen diffusion for equilibrium redistribution, and a spontaneous partial reverse reaction take place at high temperature, whereas H caging at the Ti and at the bond traps occurs when temperature is lowered. Our data demonstrate that the AlH 6-x bond is a deeper trap for H than Ti. For the first time, an explanatory model for the decomposition process has been formulated, where the catalytic action of Ti has been identified in the lowering of the activation energy for breaking the bond, thus enhancing the kinetics of the reaction. In HiPco bucky paper two peaks displayed by the low temperature elastic dissipation were attributed to hydrogen dynamics. Peak A, at around 20 K at 0.3 kHz, is nearly absent in intentionally hydrogenated samples, but after subsequent thermal treatments which partially remove hydrogen, its intensity progressively increases. When little H content is left in the sample, the peak intensity decreases and vanishes. We propose that the relaxation is due to hydrogen, and that its intensity increases with decrease of CH as more free sites are made available for the H jumps. The species giving rise to peak A is very mobile, suggesting that hydrogen is in the atomic form. Moreover classical models cannot reproduce the peak, indicating that the motion of H is governed by a quantum tunneling. Peak B manifests itself at around 150 K at 0.3 kHz. Its height increases after exposition to a H 2 atmosphere at 80 K; therefore, it should be ascribed to adsorbed molecular hydrogen. In particular, the magnetoelastic coupling between the ortho-hydrogen molecules and the hexagonal lattice of carbon nanotubes may be responsible for the process. Three more peak were found in the elastic dissipation measured on heating above room temperature, at about 350 K, 500 K and 530 K, labelled as Peaks C, D, and E, respectively. It was shown that Peak C is due to the desorption of water vapour adsorbed on the nanotubes, and Peak D to the surfactant fusion, which takes place at about the peak temperature. Peak E shows features which are typical of glassy dynamics.

 Abstract:  A review of structurally characterised ternary metal hydrides containing magnesium and alkali (A) or alkaline-earth (Ae) elements (including divalent Eu and Yb) is given. There exist 28 such compounds that cover 18 different crystal structures. Most were obtained by solid-state reactions under moderate hydrogen gas pressure while some required hydrostatic pressure in the kbar range. The compounds are saline and have ordered crystal structures. Their hydrogen contents can be rationalized in terms of mono and divalent metal cations, and hydrogen anions. Many have fluorine analogues, and those containing calcium and strontium tend to have ytterbium and europium analogues, respectively. Magnesium usually adopts octahedral and rarely tetrahedral or pentagonal bipyramidal hydrogen configurations. The metal configurations around hydrogen are mostly octahedral and tetrahedral, but square pyramidal, trigonal bipyramidal, trigonal and linear configurations are also found. Compared to binary hydrides, the metal-hydrogen bonds are generally shortened which is reflected by a volume contraction. The hydrogen storage efficiencies for A metal compounds reach 6.0 wt.% and 88 g l-1 (NaMgH3) and for Ae metal compounds 5.7 wt.% and 99 g l-1 (Ca4Mg3H14). The compounds generally desorb hydrogen above 670 K at 1 bar. The europium containing hydrides order magnetically at temperatures below 19-32 K. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  Molecular hydrogen is well-known for its weak van der Waals potential, and as a result, its compressibility, even in its liquid and solid state. This fact gives rise to a large pΔV term, which under the right conditions can overcome unfavorable energy and entropy changes for the confinement of H2, as demonstrated for the confinement of H2 in graphite. It produces a remarkable two dimensional array of H2 with ordered orientation, as H2 is forced into the narrow and seemingly inhospitable space sandwiched between two hexagonal carbon rings. H2 is thus a unique case in host–guest interaction and in the storage and confinement of gases, as pressure in the gigapascal range provides a powerful variable to manipulate the interaction between H2 and solid hosts. © 2004 The American Physical Society.

 Abstract:  The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy's (FE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), in partnership with private industries, is leading the development and demonstration of high efficiency solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and fuel cell turbine hybrid power generation systems for near term distributed generation (DG) markets with an emphasis on premium power and high reliability. NETL is partnering with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in developing new directions in research under the Solid-State Energy Conversion Alliance (SECA) initiative for the development and commercialization of modular, low cost, and fuel flexible SOFC systems. The SECA initiative, through advanced materials, processing and system integration research and development, will bring the fuel cell cost to $400 per kilowatt (kW) for stationary and auxiliary power unit (APU) markets. The President of the U.S. has launched us into a new hydrogen economy. The logic of a hydrogen economy is compelling. The movement to a hydrogen economy will accomplish several strategic goals. The U.S. can use its own domestic resources - solar, wind, hydro, and coal. The U.S. uses 20 percent of the world's oil but has only 3 percent of resources. Also. the U.S. can reduce green house gas emissions. Clear Skies and Climate Change initiatives aim to reduce carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions. SOFCs have no emissions, so they figure significantly in these DOE strategies. In addition, DG - SOFCs, reforming, energy storage has significant benefit for enhanced security and reliability. The use of fuel cells in cars is expected to bring about the hydrogen economy. However, commercialization of fuel cells is expected to proceed first through portable and stationary applications. This logic says to develop SOFCs for a wide range of stationary and APU applications, initially for conventional fuels, then switch to hydrogen. Like all fuel cells, the SOFC will operate even better on hydrogen than conventional fuels. The SOFC hybrid is a key part of the FutureGen plants. FutureGen is a major new Presidential initiative to produce hydrogen from coal. The highly efficient SOFC hybrid plant will produce electric power and other parts of the plant could produce hydrogen and sequester CO2. The hydrogen produced can be used in fuel cell cars and for SOFC DG applications. Copyright © 2004 by ASME.

 Abstract:  Positron lifetime spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the study of vacancy-type defects in solids. Our positron lifetime measurements have revealed that huge numbers of excess vacancies are formed in addition to dislocations during the first hydrogen absorption process of LaNi5 and excess vacancies becomes mobile and form microvoids by a thermal activation process. For further investigation, theoretical approaches using electronic structure calculations are indispensable. In this work, we have performed theoretical calculations of positron lifetime for LaNi5-H system using first principles electronic structure calculations. By comparison between the theoretical and experimental positron lifetimes, one of the defect components during hydrogen absorption can be ascribed to the annihilation at vacancy-clusters composed of two or three Ni vacancies. The positron lifetime of the vacancy-cluster component increases over 400 ps during isochronal annealing after hydrogen desorption. The vacancy-cluster may contain not only Ni vacancies but also La vacancies, since the vacancy-cluster composed of only Ni vacancies cannot yield such a long positron lifetime. © 2002 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  The capacity, rate and reversibility of the hydrogen absorbing/desorbing reaction have been measured for the binary systems composed of rare earth metal, R (La or Ce), and transition metal, M (Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd or Pt), by Sieverts' method. These experimental results were discussed by comparing with the theoretical ones; density of states, cohesive energy and energy fluctuation, which were calculated by the extended Hückel method. Major results obtained are as follows. (1) The capacity of hydrogen absorption decreases almost linearly with increasing M components in R-M systems and it is explained in terms of the density of states. (2) The rate of hydrogen-absorbing reaction in La-M systems are larger than that of Ce-M systems. The larger absorption rate corresponds to the larger energy fluctuation. (3) The reversibility of the hydrogen absorbing/desorbing reaction is closely related with the cohesive energy of these systems. When the cohesive energy of the hydrogen absorbed system is large, a reverse (i.e. desorbing) reaction hardly occurs. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  Magnesium alanate (Mg (Al H4) 2) has been proposed as a candidate material for high-density reversible solid-state hydrogen storage, but so far has not been shown to exhibit reversible hydrogenation. This study presents the calculated crystal structure and electronic structure of Mg (Al H4) 2 from density-functional band-structure calculations within the generalized gradient approximation. The calculated structure shows a prolonged c axis compared to the experimental structure; otherwise the agreement is excellent. The electronic density of states shows that magnesium alanate is nonmetallic with a band gap of around 4 eV. The electronic structure analysis implies polar covalent bonds both between Mg and H and between Al and H, with the lowest degree of polarity between Mg and H. The calculated enthalpy of formation suggests that magnesium alanate is metastable at room temperature, and thus not suitable for reversible hydrogen storage. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

 Abstract:  Mg-Co system is employed to investigate the solid-state reactivity of Mg2Co from the elemental powder mixture of magnesium and cobalt and to describe the hydrogenation and de-hydrogenation processes of Mg 2Co. Mg2Co is successfully solid-state synthesized as a non-equilibrium phase compound by the bulk mechanical alloying.

Its hydrogenation and de-hydrogenation processes are described by DSC, PCT and XRD. These processes take place in multi-step with strong dependency on the holding temperature. Hydrogenation process from Mg2Co is composed of two steps to Mg2CoH5 and dehydrogenation from Mg 2CoH5, one step to Mg2Co, at 633 K. Maximum hydrogen absorption capacity at 633 K is still limited to 2.03 mass% since hydrogenation and de-hydrogenation steps, working at higher temperature, are never activated without chemical modification to original Mg2Co. © 2006 The Japan Institute of Metals.

 Abstract:  The dehydriding and rehydriding of sodium aluminium hydride, NaAlH 4, is kinetically enhanced and rendered reversible in the solid state upon doping with a small amount of catalyst species, such as titanium, zirconium or tin. The catalyst doped hydrides appear to be good candidates for development as hydrogen carriers for onboard proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells because of their relatively low operation temperatures (120-150°C) and high hydrogen carrying capacities (4-5 wt.%). However, the nature of the active catalyst species and the mechanism of catalytic action are not yet known. In particular, using combinations of Ti and Sn compounds as dopants, a cooperative catalyst effect of the metals Ti and Sn in enhancing the hydrogen uptake and release kinetics is hereby reported. In this paper, characterization techniques including XRD, XPS, TEM, EDS and SEM have been applied on this material. The results suggest that the solid state phase changes during the hydriding and dehydriding processes are assisted through the interaction of a surface catalyst. A mechanism is proposed to explain the catalytic effect of the Sn/Ti double dopants on this hydride.

 Abstract:  The widespread use of hydrogen as both an industrial process gas and an energy storage medium requires fast, selective detection of hydrogen gas. This paper reports the development of a new type of solid-state hydrogen gas sensor that couples novel metal hydride thin films with a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) structure known as a micro-hotplate. Micro-hotplate structures are fabricated via surface silicon micro-machining, resulting in a suspended platform with an embedded heater and thermally isolated from the substrate. A rare earth metal thin film, overcoated with a palladium capping layer, is deposited on this structure and serves as the active hydrogen-sensing layer. The change in electrical resistance of this bilayer when exposed to hydrogen gas is the sensor output. Sub-second response times to 0.25% hydrogen in air and sensitivity to hydrogen concentrations below 200 ppm are measured. Rise and decay times of the response depend on the effective temperature of the micro-hotplate and decrease with increasing heater power. These results suggest that this device has the potential to meet the sensing requirements of advanced hydrogen applications. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  (Chemical Equation Presented) The present work has demonstrated the large-capacity oxygen storage of various isomorphous lanthanide oxysulfates, Ln2O2SO4 (Ln = La, Pr, Nd and Sm), which utilize the nonmetallic element (S) as a redox site instead of metallic cations. The reduction by H2 or hydrocarbons and subsequent reoxidation by O2 between Ln2O2SO4(S6+) and Ln2O2S(S2-) achieved an oxygen storage of 2 (mol of O2)·mol-1, which is 8 times larger than that of the conventional CeO2-ZrO2 material. Although the reversible redox cycle of thermostable Ln2O2SO4 with Ln = La, Sm, and Nd was possible only at high temperatures above 700 °C, the Pr system could work at an exceptionally low temperature of ca. 600°C. Furthermore, the redox of the Pr system could be accelerated in the presence of impregnated noble metals (1 wt % Pd), which supply activated hydrogen as well as oxygen by spillover. Because the elimination of a large amount of sulfate species as SO2/O2 from the bulk crystallites of sulfate precursors yields the macroporous texture of Ln 2O2SO4 and Ln2O2S with a high specific surface area, the resultant rapid gas diffusion as well as solid-gas reactions would facilitate the oxygen storage and release processes. © 2005 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  The attribute of solid state hydrogen storage materials that is most commonly the focus of evaluations is reversible hydrogen weight percent. Other material characteristics, including density, charging pressure, enthalpy and conductivity can influence the weight of storage system components and hence the overall hydrogen weight percent that is ultimately of interest. However, accounting for these effects involves some level of storage system representation that typically is not undertaken when making material assessments and comparisons. The current paper will present a simple model that represents system elements and trade-offs on a high level so that overall system performance can be estimated without the burden of detailed design studies. The model should be useful to evaluate novel materials in a more complete manner for a better assessment of their potential when implemented in a storage system. While the model has been derived based on the design of a particular NaAlH 4 system, the key attributes are sufficiently general to be applicable to a range of system designs. Using this approach, the properties of materials can be related more precisely to goals for overall system performance with modest additional effort. © 2005 Materials Research Society.

The optical switching of Mg-TM thin films from a mirror-like metallic state to an optically transparent state by exposure to 4% H2 in He is demonstrated by optical transmission and reflectivity in the 350-2500-nm region. The corresponding edge shifts in the Mg K- and TM L-edge X-ray absorption spectra indicate the presence of hydrogen as near neighbors, and its influence on the chemical states of metal thin films is demonstrated using Mg-Ni thin films as a representative example. Aluminum K-edge X-ray absorption spectra in the near-edge region were investigated to study the coordination of Al in crystalline and 0.1 M aqueous solutions of NaAlO2, Al(NO 3)3 and Al2(SO4)3. Aluminum in NaAlO2 occupies both tetrahedral and octahedral sites unlike Al in Al(NO3)3 and Al2(SO 4)3, where it retains its six-fold coordination irrespective of hydration. Bromine L-edge X-ray absorption spectra for crystalline and 0.1 M aqueous solutions of NaBr, KBr and KBrO3 were carried out to study the ligand-field splittings of core excitations which depend on inter-atomic distances, dissociation in aqueous solution, and the resulting hydration. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  A model is proposed which includes the charge transfer reaction and the formation of adsorbed hydrogen at the electrode/electrolyte interface, absorption of hydrogen into the solid-state MH electrode, recombination of adsorbed hydrogen atoms into molecular hydrogen dissolved in the electrolyte and hydrogen in the gas phase. It was found that the rate of the charge transfer reaction, as represented by the exchange current, is dependent on the partial hydrogen pressure (PH2) in a rather complex way: a positive linear dependence between log I0 and log PH2 is found at relatively low partial pressures, which subsequently passes through a maximum, turning into a negative dependence at higher partial pressures. Both the slopes of the lines and the turning points are found to be strongly dependent on the rate constants of the various reactions. The theoretical model has been verified with both switchable mirror MH thin film electrodes and multicomponent MH electrode materials, nowadays widely applied in commercial NiMH batteries. The as-deduced theoretical relationship will form the basis for the modelling of complete NiMH batteries. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  Room-temperature proton conductivity, coordination geometry, and pore-diameter distribution of the title Cu(II) coordination polymer have been investigated by AC conductivity, EXAFS, and N2 adsorption isotherm measurements.

 Abstract:  Hydrogen, being a regenerative and environmentally harmless fuel, can play a crucial role in the energetic scenario of the near future. In recent years several systems for solid-state hydrogen storage have been investigated, among which a few metals and metal alloys show the most promising properties. Mg and Mg-based micro and nanocomposites are widely studied for this application owing to the high gravimetric storage capacity, even if a proper microstructure, mainly at the material surface, has to be setup in order to overtake kinetic constraints often related to the high surface reactivity. In this paper, we present our approach to this problem and report the main findings. We have examined the influence on hydrogenation/dehydrogenation characteristics of different modifications of the bulk and surface microstructure Of MgH 2 powders processed by ball milling, which appears to be one the most useful methods for preparing powders suitable for hydrogen storage.

 Abstract:  Calcium alanate [Ca (Al H4) 2] is a candidate material for high-density reversible solid-state hydrogen storage that thus far has been scarcely studied. This paper presents a scheme for solving the crystal structure of a compound based on only a few model structures from similar compounds and employs this to predict the crystal structure and electronic structure of Ca (Al H4) 2. By deliberately breaking the symmetry of the model structures down to P1, local minima may be avoided, and thus the number of required input models is smaller. Density-functional band-structure calculations within the generalized gradient approximation were used in the structural minimizations. The most stable structure was based on Ca (Ba F4) 2 and was in the orthorhombic space group Pbca with lattice constants a=1337, b=928, and c=891 pm. The electronic density of states reveals an insulator with a band gap of around 4 eV. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

 Abstract:  The existence and stability of Mg2Co and MgCo is still a controversial issue. Even though none of these compounds are included in the last assessed Mg-Co phase diagrams, some authors have claimed their existence. In this paper we propose that only one compound with more than 40 at.% Mg exists, and determine its composition, formation and stability using mainly XRD and DSC. We explore different synthesis methods: β-Mg2CoH 5 dehydriding (prepared both by reactive mechanical alloying and by sintering), mechanical alloying of Mg and Co under Ar, mechanical alloying followed by a heat treatment, and Mg-Co solid-state reaction. We conclude that MgCo is a stable compound, whose formation process can be greatly influenced by kinetic factors that may suppress its presence in favor of MgCo2, the only well-known stable Mg-Co compound. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  The cyclic stability of metallic titanium during absorption-desorption runs in continuous flow system has been studied in the presence of variable level of impurities such as H2O, O2 and N2 in argon and helium flows. Hydrogen absorption-desorption cycles performed in vacuo were reproducible with respect to the absorption rates and uptakes, while absorption-desorption cycles carried out in the flows of carrier gases in the thermoprogrammed mode resulted in the gradual decrease of hydrogen uptakes followed by a shift of absorption maxima from 800 K to 1000 K. Mass-spectral analysis of the main impurities in a flow of gases revealed that during hydrogen absorption-desorption traces of water, oxygen and nitrogen are consumed by titanium. For the samples subjected to several absorption-desorption cycles in the flow of inert gas XRD revealed the formation of nitrogen-containing titanium compounds, while XPS showed surface enrichment in nitrogen, while oxygen concentration was constant. Nitrogen consumed at higher temperatures during the TPD runs provides better inhibition of hydrogen absorption compared to water and oxygen. Final deactivation state of titanium correlates in general with the overall amount of impurities in the stream. Although deactivation is controlled mostly by the level of toxic impurities in the feed, certain parameters, i.e., hydrogen absorption/desorption rates are dependent on the nature of neutral media - in contrast to helium, noticeable hydrogen desorption occurs even at room temperature in a flow of pure argon. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  A series of hypercrosslinked polymer networks has been synthesized by the self-condensation of bischloromethyl monomers such as dichloroxylene (DCX), 4,4′-bis(chloromethyl)-1,1′-biphenyl (BCMBP), and 9,10-bis(chloromethyl)anthracene (BCMA). These materials are predominantly microporous and exhibit Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of up to 1904 m2/g as measured by N2 adsorption at 77.3 K (Langmuir surface area = 2992 m2/g). Networks based on BCMBP exhibit a gravimetric storage capacity of 3.68 wt % at 15 bar and 77.3 K, the highest yet reported for an organic polymer. The micro- and mesostructure of the networks is explained by a combination of solid-state NMR, gas sorption measurements, pycnometry, and molecular simulations. The isosteric heat of sorption for H 2 on these materials is found to be in the range 6-7.5 kJ/mol. A molecular model is presented for ap-DCX network that simulates well certain key physical properties such as pore volume, pore width, absolute density, and bulk density. This model also predicts the isotherm shape and isosteric heat for H2 sorption at 77.3 and 87.2 K but overestimates the absolute degree of H2 uptake, most likely because of a degree of occluded, inaccessible porosity in the real physical samples. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

It encourages the use of solar energy, by cost-effective production of solar panels by eliminating the need to build them from silicon. Nanoscale science is also facilitating a better understanding of the properties of different fuels to deliver energy more efficiently. The materials science department of Cambridge University, UK, is developing nanotechnology that can reduce the UK's electricity consumption by 16% by using white light emitting diodes (LED).

 Abstract:  The development of morphological solid-state structures in sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone) copolymers (acid form) by hydrothermal treatment was investigated by water uptake, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TM-AFM). The water uptake and DMA studies suggested that the materials have three irreversible morphological regimes, whose intervals are controlled by copolymer composition and hydrothermal treatment temperature. Ambient temperature treatment of the membranes afforded a structure denoted as Regime1. When the copolymer membranes were exposed to a higher temperature, AFM revealed a morphology (Regime2) where the phase contrast and domain connectivity of the hydrophilic phase of the copolymers were greatly increased. A yet higher treatment temperature was defined which yielded a third regime, likely related to viscoelastic relaxations associated with the hydrated glass transition temperature (hydrated Tg). The required temperatures needed to produce transitions from Regime1 to Regime2 or Regime3 decreased with increasing degree of disulfonation. These temperatures correspond to the percolation and hydrogel temperatures, respectively. Poly(arylene ether sulfone) copolymer membranes with a 40% disulfonation in Regime2 under fully hydrated conditions showed similar proton conductivity (∼0.1 S/cm) to the well-known perfluorinated copolymer Nafion® 1135 but exhibited higher modulus and water uptake. The proton conductivity and storage modulus are discussed in terms of each of the morphological regimes and compared with Nafion 1135. The results are of particular interest for either hydrogen or direct methanol fuel cells where conductivity and membrane permeability are critical issues. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  The state of the titanium catalyst species formed upon doping and hydrogen cycling of NaAlH4 with Ti-catalysts was studied by X-ray diffraction analysis. After doping with TiCl3, Ti is present as an hcp-Ti(Al) solid solution, while for the Ti(OBu)4 doped system, Ti exists as an XRD-amorphous phase. Cycling of hydrogen for 1.5 times results in transformation of these initially different Ti compounds into similar compounds, whose composition is dependent on the temperature. Thus, if low temperatures were used during the cycling process (up to 175 °C) an amorphous Al-Ti alloy formed, while upon using high temperatures (200 °C and higher) Ti was present as an AlxTi intermetallic. Correlation of the XRD and hydrogen desorption curves shows that the most active catalyst species in the present system is the amorphous Al-Ti alloy, whereas a decreased catalytic activity is found for the AlxTi intermetallic. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  The temperature dependent optical properties of certain thin films are used in so-called thermochromic devices. As an alternative to a single layer of, e.g. VO2, which displays a temperature dependent optical transmission, we propose the use of an encapsulated metal-hydride bilayer (i.e. a switchable mirror and a hydrogen storage layer). Due to differences in the thermodynamic properties of the two metal-hydride layers, a temperature change results in the migration of hydrogen from one layer to the other, thereby changing the optical properties of the switchable mirror metal-hydride. Depending on the materials chosen the transition can be optimized for transmission, reflection or absorption. Hence, the use of metal-hydride bilayers allows the fabrication of a thermochromic absorber.

 Abstract:  Magnesium hydride is a very attractive material for solid state hydrogen storage due to their high mass and volume capacity, but its slow absortion/desortion kinetics does not favours its practical use in mobile applications. Recently it has been observed that the addition of small quantities of transition metals or their oxides has an important catalytic effect on its hydrogen sorption kinetics. Although this effect is well documented very little is known about the precise mechanisms involved in the observed sorption rate improvement. We present here a study of the sorption properties of several samples in the MgH2/Fe system prepared by mechanical alloying in H2 atmosphere and starting from mixtures of Mg or MgH2 with Fe or Fe2O3 of varying composition. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy, before and after milling and after several H2 absorption and desorption cycles in a Sievert-type volumetric apparatus. Some differences were found in the desorption kinetics that can be correlated with the microstucture resulting from the milling process. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  In the present work, precipitated silica, liquid polyisoprene, and PDMS-PI block copolymer are mixed in different formulations. The dynamic Theological properties of the resulting uncured materials are measured and are used to assess filler-filler networking. In small-amplitude tests, composites containing PDMS-PI exhibit lower values of the dynamic storage modulus (G′) than those observed in control samples prepared without copolymer additives. The control samples remain stable during several months of storage, while samples containing low molecular weight block copolymers show evidence of an aging process. The Theological manifestations of this aging include a pronounced decrease in small-amplitude G′ with time, accompanied by weakening amplitude-dependence of both G′ and G″. These suggest a progressive reduction of filler-filler interactions, presumably caused by the development of a block copolymer layer at the filler-polymer interface. The make-up of that interfacial region is investigated by means of magic-angle spinning solid-state 1H NMR experiments carried out on bound polymer fractions that survive extraction in a good solvent. Spin-spin relaxation times and the intensities of the relaxation modes associated with these characteristic times are used to identify the proportion of both PDMS and polyisoprene among the segments strongly immobilized by close contact with the silica surface and among the rest of the bound (un-extracted) interfacial layer. The changes in mechanical properties are correlated not with the overall composition of the bound polymer fraction, but with the increase in PDMS segments in close contact with the filler surface.

Instrumental to such goals will be the research and development of storage systems with performance characteristics compatible with major application requirements.

Moreover, few technologies now permit to store hydrogen by modifying its physical state in gaseous or liquid form. The variety of hydrogen needs in the energy systems and in the vehicular sector is justifying the effort on solid state (metal hydrides and carbon nanostructures) or chemical systems (chemical hydrides).

 Abstract:  The achievement of a true nanotechnology is regarded as one of the Holy Grails of modern science. To achieve this will require the construction by synthesis or self-assembly of complex functional nanoarchitectures. Such structures might contain combinations of one-, two-, and three-dimensional phenylene nanostructures. In this paper we provide an overview of recent progress in the synthesis and characterisation of new materials containing various combinations of one-, two-, and three-dimensional phenylene structural units. Though synthetically driven the ultimate aim of this work is to design and prepare new functional materials for use in electronic or other devices. Control of their optical and electronic properties by synthetic design and the evaluation of their potential for electronic applications are thus key features of our work. A vital aspect of this is the control of the supramolecular order of the materials in the solid state, by regulation of their intermolecular interactions. The attachment of bulky three-dimensional phenylene dendrimers to one-dimensional conjugated polyphenylenes or two-dimensional discotic graphite molecules enables the control of their intermolecular interactions and thus of their optical and electronic properties, with potential importance for their application in electronic devices. Linking two-dimensional graphite units together into linear and non-linear chains provides a new way to control the self-assembly of discotic materials and thus opens a way towards more new complex superstructures. Another way is demonstrated to combine elements of one- and two-dimensional polyphenylenes by the synthesis of graphite ribbons. Finally partial cyclodehydrogenation of polyphenylene dendrimers has been used to produce three-dimensional arrays of two-dimensional graphenes. Such materials have potential applications in lithium and hydrogen storage. Taken together these results present a useful step in the development of the complex architectures necessary for a true nanotechnology.

 Abstract:  The processes occurring in the course of two sequential hydrogen discharging and recharging cycles of Ti-doped sodium alanate were investigated in parallel using XRD analysis and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Both methods demonstrate that in hydrogen storage cycles (Eq. (1)) the majority phases involved are NaAlH4, Na3AlH6, Al and NaH. Only traces of other, as yet unidentified phases are observed, one of which has been tentatively assigned to an Al-Ti alloy on the basis of XRD analysis. The unsatisfactory hydrogen storage capacities heretofore observed in cycle tests are shown to be due entirely to the reaction of Na3AlH6 with Al and hydrogen to NaAlH4 (Eq. (1), 2nd hydrogenation step) being incomplete. Using XRD and NMR methods it has been shown that a higher level of rehydrogenation can be achieved by adding an excess of Al powder. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  A redox cycle process, in which CH4 and air are periodically brought into contact with a solid oxide packed in a fixed-bed reactor, combined with the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction, is proposed for hydrogen production. The sole oxidant for partial oxidation of methane (POM) is found to be lattice oxygen instead of gaseous oxygen. A perovskite-type LaFeO3 oxide was prepared by a sol-gel method and employed as an oxygen storage material in this process. The results indicate that, under appropriate reaction conditions, methane can be oxidized to CO and H2 by the lattice oxygen of LaFeO3 perovskite oxide with a selectivity higher than 95% and the consumed lattice oxygen can be replenished in a reoxidation procedure by a redox operation. It is suggested that the POM to H2/CO by using the lattice oxygen of the oxygen storage materials instead of gaseous oxygen should be possibly applicable. The LaFeO3 perovskite oxide maintained relatively high catalytic activity and structural stability, while the carbonaceous deposits, which come from the dissociation of CH4 in the pulse reaction, occurred due to the low migration rate of lattice oxygen from the bulk toward the surface. A new dissociation-oxidation mechanism for this POM without gaseous oxygen is proposed based on the transient responses of the products checked at different surface states via both pulse reaction and switch reaction over the LaFeO3 catalyst. In the absence of gaseous-phase oxygen, the rate-determining step of methane conversion is the migration rate of lattice oxygen, but the process can be carried out in optimized cycles. The product distribution for POM over LaFeO3 catalyst in the absence of gaseous oxygen was determined by the concentration of surface oxygen, which is relevant with the migration rate of lattice oxygen from the bulk toward the surface. This process of hydrogen production via selective oxidation of methane by lattice oxygen is better in avoiding the deep oxidation (to CO2) and enhancing the selectivity. Therefore, this new route is superior to general POM in stability (resistance to carbonaceous deposition), safety (effectively avoiding accidental explosion), ease of operation and optimization, and low cost (making use of air not oxygen). © 2006 American Chemical Society.

 Abstract:  The alanates (complex aluminohydrides) have relatively high gravimetric hydrogen density and are among the most promising solid-state hydrogen-storage materials. In this work, the crystal structure and electronic structure of pure and mixed-alkali alanates were calculated by ground-state density-functional band-structure calculations. The results are in excellent correspondence with available experimental data. The properties of the pure alanates were compared, and the relatively high stability of the Li3AIH6 phase was pointed out as an important difference that may explain the difficulty of hydrogenating lithium alanate. The alkali alanates are nonmetallic with calculated band gaps around 5 eV and 2.5-3 eV for the tetra- and hexahydrides. The bonding was identified as ionic between the alkali cations and the aluminohydride complexes, while it is polar covalent within the complex. A broad range of hypothetical mixed-alkali alanate compounds was simulated, and four were found to be stable compared to the pure alanates and each other: LiNa2AlH6, K2LiAlH6, K2NaAlH6, and K2.5Na0.5AlH6. No mixed-alkali tetrahydrides were found to be stable, and this was explained by the local coordination within the different compounds. The only alkali alanate that seemed to be close to fulfilling the international hydrogen density targets was NaAlH4. © 2005 Materials Research Society.

 Abstract:  A complex methodology has been developed in order to quantify the conditions of mechanical treatment in laboratory and commercial ball mills. The experimental determination of the collision frequency and the impact energy has been paralleled by an accurate numerical modelling of the balls and powder dynamics. The obtained results have been further confirmed by a direct inspection of the motion of balls and powder inside a transparent quartz reactor by means of high-speed video recording. The temperature of mechanochemical reactors has been also continuously monitored during the course of mechanical treatments. The methodology has been systematically applied to characterise on absolute basis the kinetic behaviour of a large variety of mechanically-induced structural and chemical transformations. In particular, systematic investigations have been performed on the amorphisation of intermetallic and binary systems, on the formation of extended solid solutions in immiscible systems, on the ignition of combustion-like reactions in metal-metalloid mixtures and on the hydrogen storage in nanocrystalline and amorphous multicomponent metallic alloys. Mechanochemical transformations appeared to be basically ruled by two different mechanisms characterised by simple asymptotic trends and sigmoidal curves respectively.

 Abstract:  Zr-based metallic glasses might be useful for hydrogen storage application: they are known to absorb high amounts of hydrogen, but exhibiting less severe embrittlement than their crystalline counterparts. In order to understand kinetics of hydrogen absorption and desorption. Data on hydrogen diffusion are necessary. The aim of this paper is to analyze hydrogen diffusivities in melt-spun amorphous Zr69.5Cu12Ni11Al7.5 metallic glasses at high hydrogen contents. Zr-Cu-Ni-Al metallic glasses were prepared by melt-spinning; hydrogen charging was performed electrochemically in a 2:1 glycerol-phosphoric acid electrolyte. Hydrogen desorption is hindered by a thin zirconia layer formed immediately at the surface of these Zr-based alloys. Diffusivities were measured at different temperatures by the technique of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) diffusion in a static fringe field of a superconducting magnet. The analysis of the echo damping allows a model-independent determination of the hydrogen diffusion constant. For all hydrogen contents studied in this investigation, an Arrhenius-type emperature dependence of the hydrogen diffusion was observed thus indicating a simple over-barrier-hopping mechanism. Between hydrogen contents of H/M = 0.05 and H/M = 0.2, the hydrogen diffusivity does not change; at higher contents, hydrogen diffusivity was observed to decrease until reaching a constant value at H/M = 1.0. The decrease of the diffusivity can be related to an increased interaction between the hydrogen atoms. At very high concentrations, there might be amorphous phase separation, thus opening new diffusion paths along interfaces and leading to a diffusivity independent of further increase of the hydrogen content.

 Abstract:  Solid-state hydrogen storage alloys are becoming a practical method to transport and utilize hydrogen as fuel for various technologies. In this paper, the kinetics and capacity of hydrogen desorption from Mg-based alloys have markedly been enhanced by tuning the surface composition of alloy particles. Mg2Ni-Ct,x composites (where t refers to the pregrinding time and x to the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller specific surface area) were prepared by ball-milling the alloy in the presence of preground graphite, and Pd-coated Mg2Ni alloy powders were obtained by controlled chemical deposition of Pd on the alloy surface. We have found that the optimization of the pregrinding step of carbon is a determinant factor in enhancing the hydrogen desorption capacity of the Mg2Ni-10 wt.% C10,320 composites to 2.6 wt.% at 150°C, the maximum performance so far reported on desorption for Mg-based alloys. Such value can even be raised to 2.8 wt.% by applying Pd deposition on the composite.

 Abstract:  The use of hydrogen as a renewable and clean energy source is one of the most exciting news items to hit this country in a long time. President Bush, during his State of the Union Address in February of 2003, pronounced 1.2 billion dollars to jump-start the Hydrogen Economy. The Hydrogen Economy represents not only freedom from the US dependence on foreign oil, which is a national security issue, but also a necessary step toward improving the environment by eliminating the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere due to the burning of fossil fuels. However, hydrogen storage is proving to be one of the most important issues and potentially biggest roadblock, when it comes to implementation of the hydrogen economy. Of the three options that exist for storing hydrogen, i.e., in a solid, liquid or gaseous state, hydrogen storage in a solid matrix is becoming more and more accepted as the only method to have any expectation of meeting the gravimetric and volumetric densities of the recently announced FreedomCar goals; and of all the known hydrogen storage materials, complex hydrides are showing considerable promise. To this end, a physiochemical pathway that facilitates reversible H2 storage in complex hydrides has been developed. The products of this physiochemical pathway represent perhaps the highest capacity, reversible H2 storage material known to date in low temperature ranges. This new pathway was utilized to create a 5 to 6 wt% reversible H2 storage material at less than 150°C from the complex hydride, lithium aluminum hydride. Moreover, this material reversibly stores approximately 3 to 4 wt% H2 at around 100°C. The unique feature of this off-board, physiochemical route is that it enables regeneration of this complex hydride material that to date has resisted regeneration through more conventional on-board routes that are being pursued with, for example, sodium aluminum hydride. This physiochemical pathway, or variations thereof, may also be amenable to fostering the reversibility of other higher capacity complex hydrides, like other alanates and boronates. With reversibility of the lithium aluminum hydride being achieved through this physiochemical pathway, optimization of this process is currently being studied, as is the applicability of this technique to other complex hydrides. The objective of this study is to present the most recent results obtained from the author's laboratory on the dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation properties and kinetics of lithium aluminum hydride and possibly other complex hydride systems.

 Abstract:  Semiconducting metal oxide nanowires represent a class of novel materials that are of superior properties to naoparticles currently used in dye sensitized solar cell and polymer hybrid solar cells. The quasi one-dimensional nanostructure and surface states of nanowires improve carrier mobility and charge transfer through interface interactions of theses nanocomposite materials. Raman spectroscopy, especially resonant Raman spectroscopy, is used to correlate nanomaterial synthesis condition to the structural, optical and electric transport properties that are important to photocatalysis, exciton transport and recombination and hydrogen storage mechanism. For example, highly orientated ZnO nanowires studied with Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy demonstrated the high efficiency of the phonon and electron coupling. These results are compared with that of other ZnO forms such as thin film, polycrystalline powder and solid. The Raman bandwidths and shifts of nanowires revealed the phonon confinement in the quasi one-dimensional nanostructures, which is further demonstrated with In 2O 3 nanowires at 5, 10, 20, 30 nm in diameters. Room temperature photoluminescence results also show band gap shifts with nanowire dimensions. Nanowire sizes, defects and strains, controlled by synthesis conditions, have shown to determine band structure and optical phonon properties. We also discuss characterization and synthesis of carbon nanotube based composite materials including polymer electropolymerization and infiltration. Combining significantly enhanced mechanical compressive strength and excellent electric conductivity, these composite materials offer potentials to fuel cell anode materials as multifunctional hydrogen storage media.

 Abstract:  The crystal structure of N,N-dimethylthioformamidium hexachlorohafnate(IV), {(CH3)2NCHSH}2[HfCl6], obtained by dissolution of anhydrous hafnium(IV) chloride in N,N-dimethylthioformamide and storage under ambient atmosphere, has been determined from single crystal X-ray diffraction data. The bond distance distribution within the N,N-dimethylthioformamidium ion is similar to that in N,N-dimethylthioformamide molecules strongly bound to metal ions, but significantly different from that in pure N,N-dimethylthioformamide. The hafnium(IV) ion coordinates six chloride ions in a near-regular octahedral arrangement with a mean Hf-Cl bond distance of 2.447 Å. The packing in the crystal structure shows clearly the presence of hydrogen bonds of the X-(H)⋯Cl type, X = C and S, which are sufficiently strong and directional to hold the structure together. The structures of the hexachlorohafnate(IV), [HfCl6]2-, and hexachlorozirconate(IV), [ZrCl6]2-, ions in N,N-dimethylthioformamide solution have been determined by means of EXAFS, giving mean Hf-Cl and Zr-Cl bond distances of 2.44(1) and 2.45(1) Å, respectively.

 Abstract:  Positron lifetime spectroscopy is a sensitive tool for the study of vacancy-type defects in solids. Our positron lifetime measurements have revealed that huge numbers of excess vacancies are formed in addition to dislocations during the first hydrogen absorption process in some hydrogen storage materials. In this work, we have performed first-principles calculations of positron lifetimes of vacancies as well as the bulk state in LaNi5-H and Pd-H systems in order to identify lattice defects formed during hydrogen absorption and during isochronal annealing after hydrogen desorption. By comparison between the experimental and theoretical positron lifetimes, one of the defect components formed during hydrogen absorption can be ascribed to the annihilation at the vacancy clusters composed of two or three vacancies in both LaNi5-H and Pd-H systems. During isochronal annealing after hydrogen desorption in LaNi5, the positron lifetime of the vacancy-cluster component in LaNi5 increases from 190 to over 400 ps, which indicates the formation of three-dimensional vacancy clusters. On the other hand, the vacancy-cluster component in Pd decreases from 200 to 160 ps during isochronal annealing. This suggests that not three-dimensional but two-dimensional vacancy clusters are formed in the recovery process of vacancies in Pd. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  Water inside living cell fluctuates between phases of disordered liquid and ordered solid determined by polymerization and the bound water in biopolymers is considered to be of fundamental physical and biological importance. Charge storage in biopolymers i.e. the bioelectret state has been demonstrated in a variety of biomolecules e.g. amino acid derivatives, proteins, polypeptides, benzene derivatives, aromatic polyimides etc. and a number of methods have been used for these studies. In the present paper results of our studies on the charge storage or bioelectret state in diastase an enzyme, dextrin a polysaccharide and folic acid - a vitamine using TSDC technique will be examined considering the effect of hydration on TSDC peaks for the role of bound water in polarization storage.

 Abstract:  The inclusion of multiwalled carbon nanotubes in a conjugated polymer matrix results in extensive alterations in the polymer morphology. When the physical state of a substance is changed, heat is either absorbed or liberated but the temperature remains constant. The flexibility of chain molecules arises from rotation round the saturated chain bond moreover the potential energy barriers hindering this rotation. It is not surprising therefore that the flexibility of polymer chains is an important factor in determining their melting points and stability. If the substitution of carbon nanotube is random the primary effect is a decrease in the degree of crystallinity. These microstructures are governed by the balance of interactions between hydrodynamic forces (both viscous and elastic) and the forces working to retain the integrity of the disperse particles, such as interfacial tension or, in the case of solid filler and their mechanical strength. Carbon materials have long been shown to absorb as much as 60 wt% hydrogen due to their large surface areas as well as their high surface to volume ratios. In the present approach conducting polyaniline was doped with metal oxide, such as SnO2, as well as carbon nanotubes. The resulting carbon nanocomposite was made in both gel- and solid-state to study the effect of physical state on hydrogen adsorption and desorption by weight percentage. The morphology formation process and its impact on the Rheological properties of complex polymer systems, i.e. polymer blends and composites are being studied. The materials are also compared with regard to their thermal stability using DSC, and further characterized using various techniques such as FTIR. Further experiments are in progress to better understand the nature of the hydrogen storage mechanism. © 2005 Materials Research Society.

 Abstract:  Clathrate hydrates of structure II with organic cyclic oxides were identified to have the ability to include hydrogen molecules into their empty small cages at near-ambient temperature and moderate pressure. Solid-state NMR and Raman spectroscopy of the included hydrogen molecules indicate that the small cavities are both singly and doubly occupied by hydrogen molecules in the mixed hydrates. The inclusion mechanism can be derived from the critical progression of the cage occupancies as determined from in-situ kinetic experiments on formation and decomposition. The inclusion ability of hydrogen molecules was observed for several organic clathrate hydrate formers such as THF (tetrahydrofuran) and 1,4-dioxane, suggesting this to be a general property. A structural transition of the simple amine hydrate was suggested to produce a novel double CH4 + t-BuNH2 hydrate as confirmed by using microscopic analytical methods. The corresponding hydrate compositions were determined by using NMR spectroscopy to describe a tuning mechanism to increase the storage capacity. © 2006 Materials Research Society.

 Abstract:  Borohydrides are among the highest hydrogen containing compounds and many attempts have been made to use these chemicals for hydrogen storage. However the recovering of hydrogen encounter major difficulties and the thermal dehydrogenation do not lead to the expected yield. For small hydrogen production, to feed fuel cells for mobile applications for example, the ratio the weight of the system to the recoverable energy must be as low as possible. The hydrogen generation has to be as immediate as possible when energy is required and must be stopped when necessary. Usually, this is obtained from borohydrides using solutions hydrolyzed or directly converted into the cell. Attempts have been made using solid borohydrides reacted with water added with catalysts to enhance the reactivity. In fact, the catalyst dissolved in the reacting phase is lightly trapped by the hydrolyzed compounds which render the control of hydrolysis difficult. An other solution could be to depose catalyst directly on the borohydride surface to obtain a pre-catalyzed borohydride with a very low percentage of nano-sized particles uniformly scattered. Pre-catalyzed borohydrides have been prepared from alkaline earth salts added with reactive metal nano-sized particles. The metal deposition was obtained following the operating technique employed for the preparation of the heterogeneous catalysts. The borohydrides are used for reactant to displace the ligand of a organometallic precursor and to reduce the metallic cation into metal. The metal particles deposed are less than 10 nm. A large panel of metal have been tested and the choice was directed by old literature where a schedule of the hydrolytic activity of metals was described. Ruthenium, zirconium, palladium and platinum have been deposed in various percentage to measure their reactivity. In order to lower the price of the pre-catalyzed hydrogen generator, low cost metal (copper) or borides (nickel, cobalt which are directly obtained from the synthesis conditions) have been prepared and tested. The best results were obtained from ruthenium-noble metal composed particles. The reactivity of the added borohydrides is more easy to monitor and the hydrolysis is faster and more stable than when water containing the catalyst is added to pure borohydride. The activity of titanium claimed for alanates to be the more efficient metal was found to be very low. This preparation of pre-catalyzed borohydrides offer a lot of possibilities to control the hydrolysis of these compounds and open new possibilities to develop this technology from solid state borohydrides hydrolyzed with very few water with a constant hydrogen monitored production.

 Abstract:  A critical consideration in the design of commercial hydrogen storage systems is safe operation. In the search for high hydrogen capacity materials such as alanates, this attribute has been overlooked. Conventional metal hydrides have been documented to be relatively safe, and this has fallaciously led to confidence in all hydrides. While the US Dept. of Transportation has detailed guidelines for the determination of risks associated with the transport of hazardous chemicals, no guideline exist for comparing the relative safety of new hydride materials. This study was instituted to define tests appropriate for determining the risks associated with using complex hydrides and to apply these tests to catalyzed NaAlH4. Standardized ASTM and UN-DOT tests were identified. These tests and results for 2%TiCl3 catalyzed NaAlH4 will be described.

 Abstract:  In order to obtain a new anode material of hydrogen battery, perovskite-type oxide powders were prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction method and a subsequent mechanical milling using a planetary ball-milling machine. Hydrogen charge and discharge properties were investigated electrochemically in a three-electrode cell with KOH solution. As a result, the sample shown by ACe1-xMxO 3-δ (A=Sr or Ba, M=rare earth element) was found to store hydrogen in the bulk and repeat hydrogen charge and discharge at room temperature, which suggested that the oxides are candidates for anode materials of hydrogen batteries. The maximum content of hydrogen stored was 119 mA h g-1 for BaCe0.95Nd0.05O3-δ, which corresponded to the fact that 1.44 hydrogen atoms were present in one formula of the sample. However, the cycleability was degraded with increasing the cycle number. Considering higher hydrogen-storage performance in the cerium-containing perovskite-type oxides than in the others, the valence change in cerium would have an important role to store hydrogen. Furthermore, the fact that the 1.44 hydrogens stored exceed the number of cerium in the formula suggested the presence of atomic hydrogen in the perovskite-type oxide like in the hydrogen storage alloys. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

 Abstract:  Solid-state reactions of ionic hydrides with alkaline hydroxides are shown to produce hydrogen gas and metal oxides. These reactions are analogous to the well-known hydrolysis reactions of ionic hydrides. Both classes of reactions are generally exothermic and are thermodynamically favored; ΔG° < 0 near room temperature. However, solid-state hydride/hydroxide reactant mixtures are kinetically stable at room temperature and can be prepared by mechanical milling without appreciable reaction. Thus, optimally stoichiometric mixtures are possible and nearly theoretical amounts of hydrogen can be generated. Reaction occurs upon heating with H2 evolution beginning at ∼50 °C and complete reaction occurring by 200-300 °C. The reaction rate can be enhanced with additives such as TiCl3. Specifically, we discuss the reactions LiH + LiOH, 2LiH + NaOH, LiBH4 + 4LiOH, and 3LiBH 4 + 4LiOH·H2O. The 3LiBH4 + 4LiOH·H2O reaction generates approximately 10 wt.% hydrogen with more than 5 wt.% produced at temperatures below 100 °C. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

 Abstract:  Germanosilicate glasses exhibit a significant photosensitive response which has been linked to the presence of oxygen- deficient germanium point defects in the glass structure. Based on this correlation, highly photosensitive thin films have been engineered which demonstrate the largest reported ultraviolet-induced refractive index perturbations (Δn) in an as-synthesized material. Our thin-film fabrication process avoids the use of hydrogen sensitizing treatments and, thus, yields stable films which retain their predisposition for large photosensitivity for over one year of storage. Understanding the nature of the defects in such films and their relationship to charge trapping and enhanced photosensitivity is of paramount importance in designing and optimizing the materials. Toward this end, our films have been studied using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), capacitance-voltage, and optical bleaching and absorption spectroscopies. We find experimental evidence suggesting a model in which a change in spin state and charge state of isolated paramagnetic neutral Ge dangling bonds form either diamagnetic positively or negatively charged Ge sites which are largely responsible for the charge trapping and photosensitivity in these thin films. We present experimental data and theoretical modeling to support our defect model and to show the relevance of the work. ©2005 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

 Abstract:  Infroduction Microchannel Plates (MCPs) are solid state electron multipliers consisting of miffions (10E5 - 10E7 channels/cm2) of microscopic (typically 10 - 25 microns) continuous dynode electron multipliers all fused together in a solid array. (figure 1) Fabricated from a alkali doped, reduced lead silicate glass, microchannel plates are known as excellent high gain , low noise, two dimensional detectors of charged particles and electromagnetic radiation. The microchannel plate manufacturing process begins with a series ofglass fiber draws in which an acid soluble core glass (figure 2) is combined with an alkali soluble clad tube and drawn to form a mono fiber. Mono fibers (typically 2,000 to 4,000) are then assembled into a hexagonal preform called a multi wrap. The preform is again drawn to form a multifiber producing an overall feature size reduction of typically 2000: 1. The multi fibers then become the basic building blocks. Hundreds ofmulti fibers are next arranged to form the active area ofthe MCP. High temperature vacuum fusion is then used to fuse the multi fibers together with the solid glass border (ifused) to form a billet or boule. Standard semiconductor slicing, lapping and polishing techniques are used to prepare the wafers for chemical processing. Chemical processing consists of etching open the microchannels, adjusting the open area ratio (OAR) and preparing the silica rich emissive layer. A hydrogen firing produces is used to reduce the lead glass making it electrically conductive. Finally a thin (typically 2,000 - to 3,000 Angstroms) film ofmetaiization is vacuum deposited on both sides ofthe microchannel plate to electrically connect each of the channels in parallel, therefore ensuring the same potential is applied to each channel. Microchannel plates operate on the principle of secondary electron emission. In operation primary events enter the input side of the MCP and collide with the channel wall. If the primary event has sufficient energy, secondary electrons will result. The resultant secondary electrons will be accelerated down the channel by the electric field produced when a high voltage is applied between the electrode faces. Additional coffisions with the channel walls produce still further secondary electrons.

 Abstract:  Decay processes of H2- anions in γ-ray-irradiated solid parahydrogen were studied by using an ESR spectrometer. The following interesting results were obtained. First, the initial yields of ortho-H2- anions in the γ-irradiated solid parahydrogen were 3 times as large as those of para-H2- anions. Second, the yields of para-H2- anions decrease faster than those of ortho-H2- anions upon storage of the irradiated samples at 4.2 K. Third, the decay rate of H2- anions is accelerated by the addition of HD and D2 molecules. Fourth, H2- anions at 2.2 K decay faster than at 4.2 K. According to the parity conservation rule in a homonuclear diatomic molecule, the energy of ortho-H2- anions at the ground state is lower than that of para-H2- anions, whereas that of ortho-H2 molecules is higher than that of para-H2 molecules at low temperatures. The first and second results are ascribed to para → ortho conversion of H2- anions. The third result indicates that nearby HD and D2 accelerate the decay of H2- anion or broaden the spectra by superhyperfine interactions. The fourth result suggests a coherent tunneling mechanism of decay of H2- anions in the solid parahydrogen.

Various aspects of these photo-induced ionic mechanisms are discussed on the basis of selected experimental results obtained with host materials of the composition MX, MX2, MPX3, M3PX4, M6PX5Hal, MO2, and (CH)n (with M = metal, X = S, Se; P = phosphorus, Hal = halogene, O = oxygen, C = carbon, and H = hydrogen). Since light-induced insertion or deintercalation of guest species changes the free energy and solid state properties of electrode systems, these phenomena could become useful for solar energy conversion ans storage as well as for optical information storage. In addition, it is shown that photo-electrochemical techniques are a versatile tool for the study of ionic processes at interfaces. © 1983.

 Abstract:  The reaction of gaseous hydrogen with hydride-forming metals and alloys often involves a hydride layer formed on the metallic surface. Under proper steady state conditions, this layer is moving into the bulk metal, retaining constant thickness and velocity. In this work, the kinetics of the moving hydride layer is analyzed, using a model combining the four main sequential steps: adsorption (chemisorption), penetration, diffusion and reaction, in which the hydrogen is transferred from the gas phase into the reaction site. The model yields the rate of absorption during the steady state hydriding process (proportional to the hydride layer velocity) as a function of the pressure, the rate constants of the system (adsorption, desorption, penetration, decomposition, diffusion and interface emission) and the critical concentrations of hydrogen in the hydride, Cmax, Cp and Cmin (the last is associated with the equilibrium absorption pressure Peq). According to the model, for sufficiently high pressures, the rate is pressure-independent. A simple expression for the pressure independent rate is derived. The conditions leading to rates limited by one of the four sequential steps are analyzed and demonstrated. Relatively simple expressions are derived for the rate's pressure dependence. It is shown that for the interface and diffusion controlled cases the general pressure dependence is of the form: Rate-1∝[(P/Peq)1/2-1]-1. For the adsorption controlled case the pressure dependence is Rate∝(P-Peq). Based on the model, a numerical procedure is proposed for a system, removed from an initial steady state, describing the time-dependent approach to the new steady state determined by the applied change. The model is successfully tested for a real case, the uranium-hydrogen system, which is shown to obey the interface control rate equations.

 Abstract:  The performance of the atomic hydrogen maser can be markedly improved by increasing the fraction of hydrogen atoms in the (F=1, m=O) state that enter the maser's storage bulb. In the conventional maser design, the beam of atoms entering the storage bulb consists principally of a mixture of atoms in the desired (F= 1 , m=D) state and the (F= 1 , m= 1) state. The latter do not contribute to the maser's oscillation but degrade it by line-broadening spin-exchange collisions with the radiating atoms that provide the maser's output signal. Atoms in the unwanted state can be eliminated by the use of an improved beam optics design that uses two state selection magnets in succession, with a space between them. The pair of magnets is arranged so that hydrogen atoms effused from the source (within a limited velocity range and solid angle) are focused into the entrance aperture of the storage bulb. By inducing a transition in the region between the two magnets that reverses the orientation of each hydrogen atom with respect to the static magnetic field (i.e. , m- -m), atoms originally in the (F= 1 ,m= 1) state end up in the (F= 1 , m= -1 ) state and are deflected out of the beam by the second magnet. © 1969 IEEE.

 Abstract:  FeTi is considered a good material for solid state hydrogen storage; however, it must undergo an initial activation by either a vacuum or hydrogen annealing procedure after preparation or exposure to air. Previous studies indicate that the initial activation in vacuum causes a reduction of surface iron oxides by a solid state reaction with FeTi to produce TiO2. Palladium has also been shown to be an effective barrier for eliminating O 2 or H2 impurities in typical H2 charging gases from reaching active FeTi. These impurities cause FeTi decomposition to iron and TiO2. In this study, experiments have been performed to investigate interfacial reactions that occur between Fe2O3 and FeTi layers located below protective palladium overlayers. Vacuum annealing procedures were found to crack the palladium overlayer while forming both iron and titanium oxides below the surface. Hydrogen annealing procedures allowed reduction of the subsurface Fe2O3 by FeTi without evidence of cracking within the palladium overlayer. Both procedures produced Fe-Pd alloys, the latter procedure also forming Fe-Pd hydrides at >or=623 K. Results indicate that the application of palladium overlayers on FeTi may be successfully used provide the initial activation is performed in hydrogen environments.

 Abstract:  Bulk mechanical alloying was successfully applied to solid-state synthesis of Mg2Ni, which is a promising hydrogen storage alloy. Through XRD, TEM and PCT measurement, the synthesized product was characterized to be a single-phase Mg2Ni, excluding co-synthesized MgNi2 or residuals of nickel or magnesium as in conventional processing. The synthesized Mg2Ni has a fine microstructure with the grain size of 10-20 nm. Thermodynamic data for hydride formation are coincident with reference data, so that nano-structuring in the solid-state synthesized, stoichiometric Mg2Ni has little role to make essential change in hydrogen storage capacity and mechanism. Physical modification by enrichment of nickel via the bulk mechanical alloying enables us to obtain the nickel-enriched, nano-structured Mg2Ni and to demonstrate the phase transformation of Mg2NiH4 takes place from high temperature phase (HT-phase) to low temperature phase (LT-phase) with decreasing the holding temperature. Negative shift of formation entropy of Mg2NiH4 from HT-phase to LT-phase is corresponding to the hydrogen ordering, where a part of octahedral vacancy sites in Mg2Ni structure is only occupied by hydrogen atoms. Formation of LT-phase is also verified by XRD analysis working together with PCT measurement. Positive shift of formation enthalpy of Mg2NiH4 from HT-phase to LT-phase drives a significant increase of plateau pressure in the PCT diagram. Non-equilibration of nano-structured Mg2Ni leads to control of hydride formation process. Use of these non-equilibrium phase materials helps us to understand various unknown properties of metal hydrides.

 Abstract:  The dehydriding of sodium aluminum hydride, NaAlH4, is kinetically enhanced and rendered reversible in the solid state upon doping with selected titanium compounds. Following the initial reports of this catalytic effect, further kinetic improvement and stabilization of the cyclable hydrogen capacity have been achieved upon variation in the method of the introduction of titanium and particle-size reduction. Rapid evolution of 4.0-wt % hydrogen at 100°C has been consistently achieved for several dehydriding/rehydriding cycles. An improved, 4.8-wt % cyclable capacity has been observed in the material doped with a combination of Ti and Zr alkoxide complexes. Doping the hydride with Ti(OBun)4 and Fe(OEt)2 also produces a synergistic effect, resulting in materials that can be rehydrided to 4 wt % at 104°C and 87 atm of hydrogen within 17h. The improved kinetics allowed us to carry out constant-temperature, equilibrium-pressure studies of NaAlH4 that extended to temperatures well below the melting point of the hydride. The 37-kJ/mol value determined for enthalpy of the dehydriding of NaAlH4(s) to Na3AlH6 and Al and the hydrogen plateau pressure of 7 atm at 80°C are in line with the predictions of earlier studies. The nature of the active catalyst and the mechanism of catalytic action are unknown. The catalytically enhanced hydrides appear to be strong candidates for development as hydrogen carriers for onboard proton exchange membran (PEM) fuel cells. However, further research and development in the areas of rehydriding catalysts, large-scale, long-term cycling, safety and adjustment of the plateau hydrogen pressure associated with dehydriding of AlH-6 are required before these materials can be utilized in commercial onboard hydrogen-storage systems.

 Abstract:  Thermodynamically stable Ti3Ir with the Cr3Si (A15)-type crystal structure can gradually be transformed into a metastable Ti3Ir alloy with a bcc crystal structure by high-energy ball-milling for 12.5 h. The long-term ball-milling for up to 112 h, however, is accompanied by a solid-state reaction between Ti3Ir and the vial material leading to the formation of a nano-crystalline or amorphous MgZn2-type phase with the Ti(Fe1.85Ir0.15) stoichiometry and a micro-crystalline thermodynamically stable CsCl-type phase. Both the CsCl- and MgZn2-type phases were obtained in the crystalline form after annealing ball-milled Ti3Ir. Properties of the A15 Ti3Ir alloy changed considerably after ball-milling. The superconducting transition observed in the original A15 alloy at approx. 4.3 K no longer exists in the ball-milled material. The electrochemically determined hydrogen storage capacity of the ball-milled alloy also decreases in comparison to the A15 material from 269 to 104 mAh/g. On the contrary, the electrochemical discharge capacity of Ti3Ir increases from 45 to 104 mAh/g after ball-milling.

 Abstract:  A series of hydrous ruthenium oxide (RuO2·xH2O) samples annealed at different temperatures have been studied by solid-state 1H NMR spectroscopy. The proton dynamics of the RuO2·xH2O samples was characterized for the first time through variable-temperature 1H spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) measurements. For the RuO2·xH2O samples annealed at temperatures lower than 100 °C and higher than 200 °C, a high proton activation energy was obtained, implying that the proton dynamics/diffusive motion is relatively restrained, whereas the samples annealed at temperatures between 100 and 200 °C exhibited relatively low proton activation energies, indicating that the protons can easily diffuse into the bulk of the material. Therefore, the proton activation energy correlates strongly with the hydrogen transfer and storage ability of the proton-conducting materials. In combination with electrochemical measurements, our NMR data also suggest that the coexistence of the Ru2+, Ru3+, and Ru4+ valency states in the local structure of the RuO2·xH2O is crucial for hydrogen transfer and storage ability.

 Abstract:  The reversible hydrogen storage properties of Ti-catalyzed NaAlH4 (and associated Na3AlH6) were studied as a function of Ti-content using a dry preparation technique consisting of the ball-milling of NaAlH4+TiCl3 mixtures (0-9 mol.% TiCl3). This process is believed to result in the in situ solid-state introduction of metallic Ti via the reduction of the TiCl3 by the Na-component of NaAlH4 (to form NaCl). Properties studied were hydriding and dehydriding rates and reversible gravimetric H-capacity as a function of starting TiCl3 content. Detailed isothermal kinetic studies were done over a wide temperature range (20-225 °C) and treated by Arrhenius analysis. All kinetics were found to follow the Arrhenius equation and the changes of thermal activation energies and rate constants with TiCl3-content were observed that may give valuable insights into the as-yet unknown mechanistic factors that control H2 desorption and absorption kinetics. Ti increases both dehydriding and hydriding kinetics (and associated practical engineering rates), but at the substantial expense of H-capacity. The finite room temperature decomposition of the catalyzed NaAlH4 phase was reconfirmed and rates better quantified. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

 Abstract:  A number of laboratories have now demonstrated that catalyst-assisted NaAlH4 can reversibly absorb and desorb hydrogen in the solid state at moderate temperatures. An understanding of the mechanisms by which bulk decomposition and reformation of the compound can occur in the presence of a surface catalyst is important to improving the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of alanates for use in hydrogen storage applications. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), we have examined the microstructure and elemental composition of Na alanate samples, doped using a liquid Ti/Zr catalyst precursor, for a number of conditions. First, microscopy and compositional analyses were performed at different stages of the decomposition process within the first desorption cycle. Second, the material was characterized after multiple absorption/desorption cycles (five cycles). Finally, the effects of the catalyst doping procedure on particle size, surface morphology and surface composition were examined. Significant changes in particle morphology and in elemental distribution were found to be induced by the desorption and cycling processes. Importantly, our measurements indicate that the initial dehydriding reactions were accompanied by significant enhancement of Al concentration toward the surface of particles and that elemental segregation occurred with repeated absorption/desorption cycles. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

 Abstract:  The possibilities for the photochemical storage of solar energy are examined from the standpoint of maximum efficiency and mechanism. Loss factors are considered for a general endergonic photochemical reaction and it is concluded that a realistic maximum solar energy storage efficiency for any photochemical system is 15-16%. The natural process of photochemical solar energy storage, namely, photosynthesis, is analyzed and it is found that the maximum solar energy storage efficiency of photosynthesis is 9.5 ± 0.8%. Kinetic and thermodynamic limitations on a photochemical energy storage process are identified and it is shown that the desirable production of hydrogen and oxygen from water probably cannot be sensitized with visible light if only one photochemical step is employed. However, by analogy with the mechanism of photosynthesis, two photochemical reactions operating in series permit a full utilization of the photochemically active part of the solar spectrum. A possible scheme is described and analyzed as to its possibilities and potential difficulties. Finally, some practical considerations are presented not only for the photochemical production of hydrogen but also for solid state photovoltaic devices. © 1977.

 Abstract:  The transient process of the accumulation of charge in the Silicon Nitride by applying a positive voltage pulse to MONOS structure is investigated with the help of the experimental and theoretical methods (monopolar injection of electrons). The mathematical model of charge carriers transport in an amorphous nitride thin films in MONOS structures at the high electric fields has been developed. The essential peculiarity of this model is that the injected carriers from the contact are captured by a quasi-continuous spectrum of states that there are traps, having an exponential distribution of density in the nitride band gap and by the monoenergetic positively charged deep centers. The positive traps are made by the negative correlation energy defects. These defects are formed by the weak quasi-hydrogenous bonds Si -H-Si the changes of ones in consequences of a migration of hydrogen stipulate for the degradation processes in the nitride. It is established that the quasi-distributed traps are answered for the prolonged relaxation of current in the external circuit when t>>Tg in which the exponent α of function J-t-α is detrermined by the parameter of the energy distribution of traps and by the applied voltage on the structure hat is in agreement with experimental results and corresponds to the dispersive transport of carriers.

 Abstract:  In the ceria-zirconia system, two kinds of preparation methods using oxalic acid or hydrazine monohydrate have been investigated to improve oxygen release and storage properties at low temperatures. These processes consist of a reduction process and surface modification. The reductants were carbon particles produced by thermal decomposition of oxalate or a mixture of hydrazine and hydrogen produced by decomposition of hydrazine monohydrate, and the surface modification was carried out by the calcination of the obtained powders with ammonium chloride in air at 1273 K for 1 h. Cerium and zirconium chlorides produced on the surface of the solid solutions vaporized to form a chemically filed surface. As a result of the treatment, the ceria-zirconia solid solutions released a larger amount of oxygen at lower temperatures. The oxygen storage capacity of the samples measured by a pulse technique also increased after the treatment.

Conventional polycrystalline Zr-based alloys, which consist of cubic C15 Laves phase, hexagonal C14 Laves phase and non-Laves phase (such as Zr7Ni10, Zr9Ni11, Zr(NiMn)Sn0.35), show the highest discharge capacity of 342 mAh g-1 (at 60 mA g-1 charge-discharge current), which decreases by 7.8% after 300 cycles.

It was found that these materials had high discharge capacity (the maximum capacity is up to 379 mAh g-1) and long cycle life (the capacity only decreases 3% after 300 cycles). The maximum discharge capacities were found in the metallurgical microstructure and crystal-structure in Zr-based AB2 alloys. The maximum discharge capacity increases in regular nanocrystalline/C15-Laves single-phase>polycrystalline/multi-phase (Laves and non-Laves)>comorphous state/C15-Laves single-phase. It was shown that the complete crystallization method from amorphous solids is an effective way to greatly improve the electrochemical performance of Zr-based AB2 hydrogen storage electrode materials, which is not only significant for academic research but also valuable for practical applications in the NiMH battery system for pure electric vehicles (PEV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV).

 Abstract:  Since vicinal diols present in carbohydrates may form perborate esters with hydrogen peroxide and borax, such species were loaded onto peroxide bleached and unbleached mechanical pulps. These species were shown to act as slow solid-state oxidizing bleaching agents capable of partially restoring, in the dark, the brightness losses induced on mechanical pulps during direct outdoor and indoor irradiation. More specifically, bleached TMP handsheets were impregnated at pH 9.5 with a mixture comprised of 2 % borax and 1 % hydrogen peroxide. These samples were then irradiated with indoor direct sunlight for 5 hours followed by a dark bleaching period of about 7 hours. At the end of this period brightness readings were recorded and the cycle was repeated, thus simulating indoor handling of paper products. For a 33 hour of cumulative direct indoor sunlight irradiation, the percentage stabilization offered was about 70 %.When a similar solution was used to impregnate unbleached TMP samples, a brightness gain of about 10 ISO points was obtained without using any heat for the bleaching stage. While repeated irradiation and dark storage cycles, over a cumulative period of 37 hours, resulted in approximately 3 points of brightness losses, the initial brightness gains due to bleaching were maintained. The application of perborates possibly offers a potential solution to thermal reversion issues that face most mechanical pulp mills.

 Abstract:  The PuNi3-type intermetallic compounds LaNi3, CaNi3, La0.5Ca0.5Ni3, LaCaMgNi9, La0.5Ca1.5MgNi9, CaTiMgNi9, LaCaMgNi6Al3 and LaCaMgNi6Mn3 have been prepared using a powder-metallurgy-sintering method. The hydrogenation behaviour of these materials has been studied through the gas-solid reaction. The as-prepared compounds were easily activated at room temperature under a hydrogen pressure of 3.3 MPa. The pressure-composition-temperature (P-C-T) curves show a single plateau region with the exception of LaNi3-H, which shows no plateau, and La0.5Ca1.5MgNi9-H, which shows two plateaus. All of these alloys can absorb/desorb hydrogen by 1.8 wt.% under the conditions studied. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals that LaNi3H4.5 is in the amorphous state, and the other hydrides are accompanied by different expansions of the unit cell volume of the host alloy.

 Abstract:  Films of benzophenone-containing polyimides were cast from hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) solutions and vacuum-dried just above the HFIP boiling temperature (59°C) until a constant weight was achieved. Upon heating, the films exhibited 15% weight loss beginning around 150°C. Using infrared spectroscopy, it was determined that the evolved gas was HFIP, and it formed a hydrogen-bonded solid-state complex with the polyimide. The films still contained nearly 15% HFIP 18 months after casting, a testament to the room temperature stability of the complex. The HFIP-complexed polyimide films exhibited higher gas permeabilities and reduced selectivities compared to the same polyimide cast from dimethylformamide. These transport properties were attributed to plasticization of the polyimide by the HFIP, as evidenced by a reduced storage modulus and glass transition temperature compared to the uncomplexed polyimide.

"Seperate the questions with commasTitle:Temperature dependence of the morphology and mechanical properties of poly(vinyl alcohol) drawn films prepared by gelation/crystallization from solutions by X-ray and solid state 13C NMR
 Abstract:  The morphology and mechanical properties of PVA were studied using atactic poly(vinyl alcohol) (at-PVA) dry gel films prepared by crystallization from solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and water (H2O) mixtures, in which Me2SO/H2O composition was set to be 60:40. The hot homogenized solution was quenched by pouring it into an aluminum tray controlled at -80°C, thus generating a gel. The crystal lattice modulus along the chain axis was measured by X-ray diffraction. The values were 200-220 GPa, which is independent of temperature up to 170°C. However, the values became lower with further increase in temperature and the value at 200°C became 133 GPa. This tendency is different from the previous reports showing rapid decrease in the crystal modulus at higher temperature than 120°C. The difference means that crystallites within the specimens prepared by quenching the solution (Me2SO/H2O = 60:40) at -80°C are in much more stable state than those of the previous specimens. In spite of the temperature independence of the crystal modulus along the chain axis and the crystallinity, the storage modulus similar to Young's modulus decreases gradually with increasing temperature. To study the mechanical properties and molecular orientation of the present specimens with the stable crystallites, the orientational behavior of crystallites was estimated in terms of the orientation distribution function of crystallites, and Young's modulus was calculated by using the generalized orientation factors of crystallites and amorphous chain segments estimated from the orientation functions of crystallites and amorphous chain segments. In doing so, the theoretical calculation was carried out by using a three-dimensional model, in which the oriented crystalline layers are surrounded by an anisotropic amorphous phase and the strains of the two phases at the boundary are identical. The theoretical values were in good agreement with the experimental ones. The 13C NMR measurements suggested that the inter-molecular hydrogen bonds may be broken by drawing and the intra-molecular hydrogen bonds are more preferably formed in the mm and mr sequences with draw ratio but no marked difference in the structure exists between the crystalline and non-crystalline regions, as judged from the hydrogen bonding in the triad sequences. Even so, the spin-lattice relaxation time, T1C, decreased drastically with increasing temperature reflecting drastic activity of chain mobility. Accordingly, the drastic decrease in Young's modulus (the storage modulus) is thought to be due to the fact that chain mobility in the amorphous phase becomes more pronounced as temperature increases. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

 Abstract:  Recent interest in complex aluminohydrides as potential near ambient, ultra-high capacity, solid-state sources of hydrogen (e.g., for fuel cells) calls for an improved understanding of the processes occuring in these hydrogen-containing materiais during both the release and the uptake of hydrogen. Lithium aluminohydride (LiAlH4) rapidly releases 5.2 wt. % of hydrogen (i.e., nearly four times more than LaNi5-based alloys) during mechanochemical processing at ambient conditions in the presence of transition metal catalysts. Using a variety of solid-state characterization techniques, the mechanochemical transformations in a series of LiAlH4 - metal catalyst systems have been examined and preliminary insights on the mechanism have been obtained. Surprisingly, the well-known hydrogenating-dehydrogenating catalysts, such as Ni and Pt, are practically inactive in the mechanochemical dehydrogenation of LiAlH4.

"Seperate the questions with commasTitle:Magic angle spinning NMR study of the hydration of the wheat seed storage protein omega-gliadins
 Abstract:  The hydration of the wheat protein omega-gliadins was investigated by carbon and proton magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy. The changes observed in the protein carbon spectrum with increasing hydration in the range 0-50% show a general mobility increase but, even at 50% hydration, a number of glutamine side-chain carbons remain relatively immobilized. The results suggest that a conformational change occurs at about 35% hydration, giving a looser conformation. Carbon T1 relaxation times reflect the general mobility increase, in the MHz frequency range, by showing an order of magnitude decrease upon hydration. No distinction between T1 of the backbone and glutamine side-chain carbonyls is observed. This confirms the relative rigidity of these side-chains even at high hydration. MAS at high spinning rates has been used previously to resolve the proton spectra of hydrated omega-gliadins. Resolution was further improved by using a new high-resolution MAS probe. Interpretation of the resulting protein spectrum showed that some phenylalanine residues are considerably motionally hindered. Moreover, evidence shows that some glutamine side-chain amino groups are inaccessible to solvent. A structural model for hydrated omega-gliadins is advanced involving the formation of hydrophobic pockets held by stable intermolecular and/or intramolecular hydrogen bonding between glutamine residues. The high-resolution spectra obtained using the new probe design permitted the use of high-resolution 2D experiments for assignments and to investigate conformational properties. In an attempt to use proton relaxation parameters to characterize the protein system further, it was found that, under MAS conditions, proton T1 relaxation times are strongly dependent on spinning rate. The results indicate that great care is required when interpreting proton relaxation times recorded under MAS conditions. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

 Abstract:  A comparison of the hydrogen diffusion behaviour in microcrystalline and crystalline LaNi3.94Si0.54 films was studied using an electrochemical permeation technique. For the microcrystalline film, hydrogen diffusion transient curves were found to be composed of two steps of transients, which might be ascribed to the transition from α phase to hydride phase and the subsequent migration of the phase boundary. Such a behaviour, however, was absent for the crystalline counterpart within the time range of our investigation, and we attributed this to the slower diffusion as compared with the microcrystalline film. Hydrogen diffusion coefficients in microcrystalline films increased evidently with increasing hydrogen concentration, whereas there was a negligible concentration dependence in the crystalline counterpart. Similar to an earlier suggestion, the electrochemical permeation technique may be useful in the investigation of hydride formation in solid state hydrogen storage materials in addition to providing hydrogen transport data. © 1995.

 Abstract:  Mg2Ni was synthesized by a solid-state reaction from the constituent elemental powder mixtures via bulk mechanical alloying. Since homogeneous refining and alloying takes place efficiently by repeated forging, the process time can be reduced to one fiftieth of time duration necessary for conventional mechanical milling and attrition. This MA Mg2Ni alloy can be obtained as a high dense powder compact with a relative mass density in the order of 85%; its average powder particle size ranges from 1 to 3 μm. The prepared Mg2Ni alloy has a sufficiently high reaction rate to hydrogen even at relatively lower temperatures and a potential to form a ternary hydride on the pressure-composition isotherms from 523 to 623 K. The enthalpy and entropy for ternary hydride formation were estimated to be -28. 7 KJ/mole-H and -46.8 J/K/mole-H, respectively.

 Abstract:  FeTi is an excellent hydrogen storage material; however, it deactivates after numerous charge-discharge cycles. This study investigates the mechanism for deactivation as well as the use of a protective palladium coating to eliminate deactivation using a non-destructive technique which samples the integrity of the FeTi below the palladium coating. Specifically, conversion electron Mössbauer spectroscopy (CEMS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ""static"" secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) were used to analyze the topmost 10nm, 2nm and monolayer respectively of a 10nm FeTi specimen after various annealings and reduction treatments. A 5 nm palladium coating was applied to an identical specimen and analyzed with CEMS after similar treatments. Analyses of the uncoated specimen revealed that titanium, initially in FeTi, reacted with O2-H2O impurities in the H2 charging gas to produce TiO2 at the outermost surface while forming iron domains in the near-surface region. During annealing at 450 K for 3 h, a solid state reaction was also noted to occur in which Fe2O3 was reduced by adjacent titanium in FeTi. This solid state reaction parallels the gas phase reaction for initial activation of FeTi after exposure to air. Analyses of the palladium-coated specimen could only be performed using CEMS because of its unique ability to probe below the coating at the Pd-FeTi interface, a region which is below the sampling depths of both XPS and static SIMS. The palladium coating provided an effective oxygen barrier which prevented deactivation and maintained the integrity of FeTi. © 1988.
