Owing to the lightweight, high hydrogen storage density and abundant reserves, MgH2 has been widely studied as one of the most promising solid-state hydrogen storage materials. However, defects such as stable thermodynamics, sluggish kinetics and rapid capacity decay have seriously hindered its practical application. This article reviews recent advances in catalyst doping and nanostructures for improved kinetic performance of MgH2/Mg systems for hydrogen release/absorption, the tuning of their thermodynamic stability properties by alloying and reactant destabilization, and the dual thermodynamic and kinetic optimization of the MgH2/Mg system achieved by nanoconfinement with in situ catalysis and ball milling with in situ aerosol spraying, aiming to open new perspectives for the scale-up of MgH2 for hydrogen storage applications.

!003,"MgH2, as one of the typical solid-state hydrogen storage materials, has attracted extensive attention. However, the slow kinetics and poor cycle stability limit its application. In this work, LiBH4 and YNi5 alloy were co-added as additives to MgH2 via ball milling, thereby realizing an excellent dehydrogenation performance and good cycle stability at 300 °C. The MgH2-0.04LiBH4-0.01YNi5 composite can release 7 wt.% of hydrogen in around 10 min at 300 °C and still have a reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 6.42 wt.% after 110 cycles, with a capacity retention rate as high as 90.3 % based on the second dehydrogenation capacity. The FTIR results show that LiBH4 can reversibly absorb and desorb hydrogen throughout the hydrogen ab/desorption process, which contributes a portion of the reversible hydrogen storage capacity to the MgH2-0.04LiBH4-0.01YNi5 composite. Due to the small amount of LiBH4 and YNi5, the dehydrogenation activation energy of MgH2 did not decrease significantly, nor did the dehydrogenation enthalpy (∆H) change. However, the MgNi3B2 and in-situ formed YH3 during the hydrogen absorption/desorption cycles is not only beneficial to the improvement of the kinetics performance for MgH2 but also improves its cycle stability. This work provides a straightforward method for developing high reversible hydrogen capacity on Mg-based hydrogen storage materials with moderate kinetic performance.

Further improvement of its kinetics and thermodynamic performances is needed to achieve widespread application. This article investigated the hydrogen storage properties of the thermodynamic optimized Mg-TiCrV hydrogen storage composite modified by layered Ti3C2 materials containing different 3d transition metal particles (Fe, Co, Ni). Mg-TiCrV/Ti3C2-X (X = Fe, Co, Ni) composites can absorb more than 5.30 wt% hydrogen within 1 min at 453 K under 3 MPa hydrogen pressure, and desorb more than 5.25 wt% hydrogen within 60 min at 543 K to 0.1 MPa. In particular, Mg-TiCrV/Ti3C2-Ni composite exhibited the best hydrogen storage properties, which can desorb 4.98 wt% hydrogen within 60 min at 523 K to 0.1 MPa hydrogen pressure and absorb 5.80 wt% hydrogen within 1 min at 453 K under 3 MPa hydrogen pressure.

!005,"The design of catalysts with excellent catalytic activity plays an important role in the field of solid-state hydrogen storage of new energy sources. Herein, a novel hydrangea-like NiO@NiMoO4 composite catalyst was prepared through a facile hydrothermal reaction. Subsequently, NiO@NiMoO4 was doped into MgH2 by ball milling to solve the problems of high dehydrogenation temperature and slow desorption kinetics of MgH2. It can be seen from the experimental results that the MgH2 + 10 wt% NiO@NiMoO4 composite starts to dehydrogenate at about 190 °C, which is about 170 °C lower than that of pure MgH2. Meanwhile, after complete dehydrogenation, the composites can start to absorb hydrogen below 40 °C. Compared with pure MgH2, the activation energy of hydrogen absorption and dehydrogenation of the composite decreased by 47.6 kJ/mol and 46.5 kJ/mol, respectively. In 10th cycle tests, the MgH2 + 10 wt% NiO@NiMoO4 composite still has good cycle stability. After adding a small amount of biomass charcoal, the hydrogen storage capacity can even be maintained above 97%. Furthermore, the characterization results show that the in situ generated new species Mo and Mg2Ni/Mg2NiH4 synergistically promote the adsorption and dissociation of hydrogen.

!006,"The 0.55LiBH4-0.45Mg(BH4)2 (LMBH) eutectic composite is promising for solid-state hydrogen storage, as it exhibits a high hydrogen capacity and a very low initial dehydrogenation temperature. However, its main hydrogen release steps still require higher temperatures. In the present study, few-layer Ti2C has been synthesized and utilized as catalysts in the LMBH. Compositing LMBH with varying amounts of Ti2C (10, 20, 30, and 40 wt%) results in low initial dehydrogenation temperatures (164–110 °C), fast desorption rates and high hydrogen capacities (7.5–10.5 wt%) at a low temperature of 260 °C. The LMBH-30Ti2C composite yields 6.5 wt% H2 even at as low as 200 °C. Additionally, the LMBH-30Ti2C composite could reversibly store 3.5 wt% H2 during the second to fourth dehydrogenation cycles without degradation. The outstanding hydrogen storage performance could be attributed to decomposition driven by reactions between high-valence Ti ions and LMBH, the in-situ formation of the active metal Ti catalyst, and the prevention of aggregation in the Ti2C-doped LMBH. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","However, its main hydrogen release steps still require higher temperatures.

!007,"Magnesium hydride is one of the most sought-after materials for solid state hydrogen storage due to its low cost and high gravimetric capacity (7.6 wt% hydrogen). However, high temperature of desorption (>350 °C) and slow kinetics limit its use for commercial on-board applications. In this work, accumulative roll bonding (ARB) technique has been utilized to synthesise Mg–LaNi5–Mg2Ni-soot hybrid with enhanced hydrogen storage properties. It is seen that the hybrid absorbs ∼6.2 wt% hydrogen at a plateau pressure of ∼2 bar at 300 °C and exhibits fast kinetics with ∼6.6 wt% hydrogen absorption within ∼30 min at 300 °C and 20 bar hydrogen pressure. The role of Mg2Ni as a catalyst as well as hydrogen absorbing medium provides an effect akin to ‘hydrogen pump’, thus enhancing the rate of hydrogen absorption. Presence of carbon in various forms such as aciniform, carbonaceous microgel and cenospheres (derived from soot) plays a vital role by providing channels for diffusion of hydrogen through the hybrid.

!008,"Herein, a novel approach by designing Schottky-structured CoNi nano-alloys were introduced. After compositing with MgH2, its initial hydrogen absorption started at a low temperature of 40 °C. At a temperature of 300 °C, 6.5 wt% of H2 was released in only 10 min. Furthermore, the kinetic analysis revealed a pivotal transformation in the control model for dehydrogenation of MgH2, shifted from surface penetration to diffusion at a moderate temperature of 250 °C with the introduction of CoNi-CoO@rGO. After modification, the activation energy for hydrogen de/absorption decreased from 116 kJ/mol and 79.39 kJ/mol, to 66 kJ/mol and 54.39 kJ/mol, respectively. It is noteworthy that the CoNi-CoO@rGO-modified MgH2 exhibited excellent cycling performance, retained an impressive hydrogen storage capacity of 97% after 20 cycles at 300 °C. The innovation of this work lies in the following three aspects: 1) the uniform distribution of CoNi-CoO@rGO nanoparticles on the surface of MgH2 significantly enhanced the contact area and promoted the catalytic activity, 2) the synergistic effect between Mg2Co-Mg2CoH5 and Mg2Ni-Mg2NiH4 attenuate the intensity of the Mg-H bond and quickened the post-discharge of MgH2, 3) the incorporation of a CoO-induced Schottky structure accelerated the H transfer in MgH2 and improved the hydrogen absorption and release efficiency. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","After compositing with MgH2, its initial hydrogen absorption started at a low temperature of 40 °C.

!009,"Despite the promise of TiFe-based alloys as low-cost solid-state hydrogen storage materials with mild operating conditions and reasonable hydrogen capacity, their initial hydrogenation process is difficult, hindering broad utilization. The effect of alloying element on the initial hydrogenation kinetics of TiFe alloys, TiFe0.9M0.1 (M = V, Cr, Fe, Co and Ni), was evaluated by analyzing changes to the passivating surface oxide layer that inhibits hydrogen permeation, as well as the ease of initial-stage hydrogen absorption into the underlying matrix. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atom probe tomography revealed key variations in surface oxide compositions and thinning of the passivating oxide layer compared to pure TiFe, which suggests suppressed oxide growth by alloying-induced elemental redistribution. At the same time, density functional theory calculations predicted exothermic formation of hydride nuclei when alloying with V or Cr, as well as a reduced nucleation barrier when alloying with Co or Ni. Overall, these results are consistent with the observed experimental trend of the activation kinetics. We propose that improvements in activation kinetics of TiFe with alloying arises from the combined effect of reduced passivating oxide thickness and easier hydride nucleation, offering a starting point for alloy design strategies towards further improvement. © 2022 The Author(s)","At the same time, density functional theory calculations predicted exothermic formation of hydride nuclei when alloying with V or Cr, as well as a reduced nucleation barrier when alloying with Co or Ni.

!010,"NaH and LiH are theoretically capable of storing hydrogen, but several challenges remain to be overcome before they can be widely used for hydrogen storage. In this study, LiH and NaH were ball-milled and the effect of surface area and hydrogen pressure on hydrogen storage capacity was investigated using the solid-state hydrogen storage method. XRD patterns and Raman spectra show significant shifts in main peak positions of LiH and NaH after hydrogen adsorption. BET analysis shows a significant increase in the specific surface area of LiH and NaH from 6.25 m2/g to 12.35 m2/g and from 1.34 m2/g to 2.33 m2/g respectively due to ball milling. The FTIR spectra showed more bonds in the 400–1200 cm⁻1 fingerprint region after storing hydrogen in LiH and NaH. This suggests structural changes with enhanced bond bending due to hydrogen. At 9 bar pressure, LiH and NaH exhibited excellent hydrogen storage, with ball-milled LiH reaching about 3.55 wt% and 652 sccm, and NaH achieving approximately 1.58 wt% and 291 sccm. These results highlight the significant influence of surface area and hydrogen pressure on hydrogen storage potential. Incorporating the storage potential within the evaluation of PEM fuel cell performance, we suggest that an increased storage capacity directly corresponds to an augmented power density. The analysis of power density over time revealed that the hydrogen adsorbed ball-milled LiH exhibited the highest power density, peaking at 0.075 Wcm−2 over the long term. In contrast, LiH displayed a lower power density (0.025 Wcm−2) while maintaining its long-term performance. The hydrogen adsorbed NaH and hydrogen adsorbed ball-milled NaH displayed power densities 0.050 Wcm−2 and 0.073 Wcm−2, respectively, but they showed short-term performance. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","This suggests structural changes with enhanced bond bending due to hydrogen.

!012,"Magnesium hydride is one of the most promising solid-state hydrogen storage materials for on-board application. Hydrogen desorption from MgH2 is accompanied by the formation of the Mg/MgH2 interfaces, which may play a key role in the further dehydrogenation process. In this work, first-principles calculations have been used to understand the dehydrogenation properties of the Mg(0001)/MgH2(110) interface. It is found that the Mg(0001)/MgH2(110) interface can weaken the Mg–H bond. The removal energies for hydrogen atoms in the interface zone are significantly lower compared to those of bulk MgH2. In terms of H mobility, hydrogen diffusion within the interface as well as into the Mg matrix is considered. The calculated energy barriers reveal that the migration of hydrogen atoms in the interface zone is easier than that in the bulk MgH2.

Nevertheless, its outrageous decomposition temperature and slow sorption kinetics hinder its application as a solid-state hydrogen storage material. This research’s objective is to investigate how the addition of titanium silicate (TiSiO4) altered the dehydrogenation behavior of LiAlH4. The LiAlH4–10 wt% TiSiO4 composite dehydrogenation temperatures were lowered to 92 °C (first-step reaction) and 128 °C (second-step reaction). According to dehydrogenation kinetic analysis, the TiSiO4-added LiAlH4 composite was able to liberate more hydrogen (about 6.0 wt%) than the undoped LiAlH4 composite (less than 1.0 wt%) at 90 °C for 2 h. After the addition of TiSiO4, the activation energies for hydrogen to liberate from LiAlH4 were lowered. Based on the Kissinger equation, the activation energies for hydrogen liberation for the two-step dehydrogenation of post-milled LiAlH4 were 103 and 115 kJ/mol, respectively. After milling LiAlH4 with 10 wt% TiSiO4, the activation energies were reduced to 68 and 77 kJ/mol, respectively. Additionally, the scanning electron microscopy images demonstrated that the LiAlH4 particles shrank and barely aggregated when 10 wt% of TiSiO4 was added.

!024,"Hypothesis: With increased development and electricity generation, great care to energy storage systems is crucial to overcome the discontinuity in the renewable production. Hydrogen is an ideal energy carrier for near future mobility, like automotive applications. Solid-state hydrogen storage materials including nanomaterials and layered systems are the key enablers to the future energy needs. However, the current materials are unable to meet all requirements in the storage capacity and commercialization. The hydrogen storage mechanisms (physical and chemical) are the key-points addressing the shortcomings in hydrogen absorption/adsorption in the interlayer space or on the surface of the material. All above require strategy for designing new hydrogen storage materials. Experiments: This review lays the recent foundations in the materials suitable for hydrogen storage particularly alloys, mixed metal oxides (MMOs), and their respective nanocomposites. Alloys and MMOs are two classes of materials with high discharge capacities, appropriate electrochemical performances, chemical stability, easy production pathways, and almost low cost. In the same vein, highly porous materials with a large surface area such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs), MXenes and carbon materials are thermodynamically and kinetically more favorable. Findings: The literature review illustrates that it is crucial to develop new materials with large-surface area, homogeneous texture, active-conductive profiles, large oxygen vacancies and low-cost. Multiphase materials (nanocomposites/hybrids) composed of at least two of above-mentioned materials can meet the established requirements in this field. Also, the present paper demonstrates a general overview of promoted understanding of hydrogen storage mechanisms on alloy/MMOs-based compounds in the energy storage systems. It is hoped that these observations pave the potential exploration directions to dominate imminent challenges in solid-state hydrogen storage. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Findings: The literature review illustrates that it is crucial to develop new materials with large-surface area, homogeneous texture, active-conductive profiles, large oxygen vacancies and low-cost.

!025,"As global energy consumption is rapidly climbing to maximum, fossil fuel resources face depletion on a global scale. The rapid depletion and higher energy demand consequences an escalation of energy prices originating from conventional sources as well as the release of greenhouse gases into the environment. Hydrogen as an alternative energy source merged as an ideal candidate, distinguished by its remarkable attributes and manifold advantages. It has an exceptional energy density of 120 MJ/kg and encompasses non-toxicity, sustainability, and a favorable environmental profile. Renewable and non-renewable sources can produce hydrogen and have versatile applications in transportation, power generation via fuel cells, and other industrial processes. Beyond having these advantages hydrogen has the benefits of energy security and can be produced locally. Nevertheless, commercial hydrogen has exceptionally low volumetric density under standard conditions which is the major obstacle in the way of its development. To cater this issue and to enhance its economic feasibility, two well-established methodologies are used by alterations in temperature and/or pressure conditions which facilitate the storage of hydrogen either in a pressurized gas or a cryogenic liquid. However, both methods incur energy consumption and pose safety concerns and complexity in the system, which raises the question of having other storage solutions. An emerging technology based on Solid-state hydrogen storage systems has recently gained substantial attention because of its high storage capacity and relatively mild temperature and pressure requirements. However, this technology is not yet mature enough because it doesn't fulfil the requirements to be implemented for industrial applications.

Our results showed that N2H4BH3 exhibits remarkable structural stability in a very broad pressure region up to 15 GPa, and then two phase transitions were identified: the first one is from the ambient-pressure Pbcn phase to a Pbca phase near 15 GPa; the second is from the Pbca phase to a Pccn phase near 25 GPa.

!029,"Magnesium hydride has great potential for solid-state hydrogen storage. However, high dehydrogenation temperature and sluggish hydrogen absorption and desorption kinetics restrict its on-board automotive application. Hydrogen desorption from MgH2 is accompanied by the formation of Mg/MgH2 interfaces, which may play a key role in the further dehydrogenation process. In this work, first principles methods were used to understand the structural, electronic, energetic and hydrogen diffusion kinetic properties of pure and Ti-doped Mg(0001)/MgH2(110) interfaces. It is found that Ti interface doping can slightly increase the interfacial stability as revealed by the work of adhesion, interface energy and electronic structure. Additionally, for both the pure and Ti-doped Mg(0001)/MgH2(110) interfaces, the removal energies for the H atoms in the interface zone are significantly low compared with that of bulk MgH2. In terms of H mobility, the Ti dopant is beneficial for H atoms migrating from the inner layers to the interface for aggregation. Furthermore, hydrogen desorption from the two interfaces mainly takes place by hydrogen diffusion within the interface rather than across the interface into the Mg matrix, and Ti doping can enhance this process significantly.

Single-atom catalysts are a promising solution to this dilemma. However, the promising graphene-based single-atom catalysts are not yet sufficient to meet the dehydrogenation needs in engineering. To further address this dilemma, we designed a novel γ-graphyne based single-atom catalysts including eight 3d transition metals for promoting the dehydrogenation process of MgH2.

Here, we prepared the Ni/C nanoparticles anchored on large-size Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, firstly introduced into LiAlH4 to investigate its catalytic effect. Dehydrogenation experiments demonstrate that LiAlH4 doped with 7 wt% Ni/C@Ti3C2 starts to release hydrogen at 56.9 °C. Also, it can release about 4.3 wt% hydrogen within 50 min at 120 °C. The activation energies of LiAlH4 doped with 7 wt% Ni/C@Ti3C2 for the first and second steps are 34.5% and 53.2% lower than the as-received LiAlH4, respectively. Under 300 °C and 40 bar hydrogen, it can absorb 0.58 wt% hydrogen. It is found that in situ formed intermetallic Al2Ti during ball milling can weaken the Al-H bonds in LiAlH4 through interfacial charge transfer and the dehybridization, benefitting for the breaking of the Al-H bond in LiAlH4.

!047,"We present a machine learning (ML) framework HEART (HydrogEn storAge propeRty predicTor) for identifying suitable families of metal alloys for hydrogen storage under ambient conditions. Our framework includes two ML models that predict the hydrogen storage capacity (HYST) and the enthalpy of hydride formation (THOR) of multi-component metal alloys. We demonstrate that a chemically diverse set of features effectively describes the hydrogen storage properties of the alloys. In HYST, we use absorption temperature as a feature which improved H2wt% prediction significantly. For out-of-the-bag samples, HYST predicted H2wt% with R2 score of 0.81 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.45 wt% whereas R2 score is 0.89 and MAE is 4.53 kJ/molH2 for THOR. These models are further employed to predict H2wt% and ΔH for ∼ 6.4 million multi-component metal alloys. We have identified 6480 compositions with superior storage properties (H2wt% > 2.5 at room temperature and ΔH < 60 kJ/molH2). We have also discussed in detail the interesting trends picked up by these models like temperature dependent variation in the rate of hydrogenation and alloying effect on H2wt% and ΔH in different families of alloys. Importantly certain elements like Al, Si, Sc, Cr, and Mn when mixed in small fractions with hydriding elements like Mg, Ti, V etc. systematically reduce ΔH without significantly compromising the storage capacity. Further upon increasing the number of elements in the alloy i.e from binary to ternary to quaternary, the number of compositions with lower enthalpies also increases. From the 6.4 million compositions, we have reported new alloy families having potential for hydrogen storage at room temperature.

Hence, a good heat management system is required to increase the charging rate. The phase change material (PCM) can be integrated into the reactor to reuse the absorption heat for hydrogen desorption. The present numerical study models the concentric cylindrical reactor with magnesium (Mg) as MH surrounded by sodium nitrate (NaNO3) as PCM using COMSOL Multiphysics v6.1. The effect of buoyancy inside the PCM domain is investigated. An iterative approach is used to determine the required amount of PCM. Copper fins are added inside both MH and PCM. The effect of the number of fins, corresponding fin thickness and pitch on hydrogen absorption are determined to optimize the MH reactor. The outcomes reveal that the hydrogen absorption rate increases with fin numbers. The reactor with 10 and 30 fins takes 86.5 and 97.3 % less time than without fins for 90 % hydrogen absorption, respectively.

The need to efficiently produce and store hydrogen, therefore, has necessitated the development of several technologies and materials for hydrogen storage to achieve the envisaged hydrogen economy. Solid-state hydrogen storage in magnesium hydride (MgH2) has shown a huge potential owing to its impressively high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen capacities of ca. 7.6 wt% and 111 g/L, respectively.

In order to realize the large-scale application of hydrogen energy, the problem of hydrogen storage must be solved. At present, there are three main ways of hydrogen storage, namely compressed hydrogen storage, liquid hydrogen storage, and solid-state hydrogen storage. Compressed hydrogen storage is the most commonly used hydrogen storage method. After the hydrogen is compressed, it is stored in the form of gas in a cylinder. It has the advantages of low cost and fast charging and discharging speed, but its volumetric hydrogen storage density is extremely low. Liquid hydrogen storage is a cryogenic hydrogen storage technology. After the hydrogen is compressed, it is cryogenically cooled to below −253°C to become liquid hydrogen for storage. Liquid hydrogen has the advantages of high storage efficiency and good volumetric hydrogen storage density, but the liquefaction of hydrogen requires a lot of energy, so its storage cost is high. Solid-state hydrogen storage technology is one of the most promising hydrogen storage technologies, which utilizes the physical adsorption or chemical reaction characteristics between hydrogen and materials to store hydrogen. It has the advantages of good safety and high volumetric hydrogen storage density. Therefore, solid-state hydrogen storage is considered to be one of the most promising hydrogen storage technologies.

MgH2 + 7 wt% Ni/V2O3 presented more superior hydrogen absorption and desorption performances than pure MgH2 and MgH2 + 7 wt% NiV-LDH. The initial discharging temperature of MgH2 was significantly reduced to 190 °C after adding 7 wt% Ni/V2O3, which was 22 and 128 °C lower than that of 7 wt% NiV-LDH modified MgH2 and additive-free MgH2, respectively. The completely dehydrogenated MgH2 + 7 wt% Ni/V2O3 charged 5.25 wt% H2 in 20 min at 125 °C, while the hydrogen absorption capacity of pure MgH2 only amounted to 4.82 wt% H2 at a higher temperature of 200 °C for a longer time of 60 min.

MgH2 has stood out as a promising solid-state hydrogen storage material due to its impressive gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen density, but its practical application is hampered by elevated thermal stability and sluggish kinetics. In this study, we introduce a solution by synthesizing Pd metallene through a one-pot solvothermal method, revealing a distinctive highly curved lamellar structure with a thickness of around 1.6 nm. Incorporating this Pd metallene into MgH2 results in a composite system wherein the starting dehydrogenation temperature is significantly lowered to 439 K and complete dehydrogenation occurs at 583 K, releasing 6.14 wt.% hydrogen. The activation energy of dehydrogenation for MgH2 was reduced from 170.4 kJ mol–1 to 79.85 kJ mol–1 after Pd metallene decoration. The enthalpy of dehydrogenation of the MgH2–10 wt.% Pd sample was calculated to be 73 kJ mol–1 H2 –1 and decreased by 4.4 kJ mol–1 H2 –1 from that of dehydrogenation of pure MgH2 (77.4 kJ mol–1 H2 –1). Theoretical calculations show that the average formation energy and average adsorption energy of hydrogen vacancies can be significantly reduced in the presence of both Pd clusters and Pd single atoms on the surface of MgH2/Mg, respectively.

One effective method to enhance heat transfer is utilizing an HTS equipped with fins and a cooling tube. Among the crucial factors for optimizing the reactor, fin efficiency (FE) plays a vital role, although it has not been explored in unsteady processes like the present one. This study introduces a novel FE technique to optimize fins in a conventional longitudinal finned tube MH reactor based on LaNi5. Due to the intricacies of the problem, making analytical estimation of FE challenging, the authors turned to the concept of reverse engineering. This approach utilizes simulated data's temporal temperature profiles to calculate the FE. The number of fins is varied from 4 to 12 while keeping the total fin weight constant. Heat transfer performance improved as the number of fins increased, but the FE deteriorated from 0.89 to 0.56 due to the reduction in fin thickness. A performance index (PI) that considers the number of fins is introduced to assess the overall performance. Its values are 0.58, 0.79, 0.96, 1.05, and 1.1 for configurations with 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 fins, respectively. The configuration with 8 fins is deemed optimal because further increasing the number of fins led to only marginal improvements in PI value.

Hydrogen sorption on the layered materials or inside porous materials is a hopeful key to drawbacks for high-performance hydrogen sorption. Hereupon, layered solids with the merit of hydrogen sorption are introduced, for the first time, including “nanostructured bi-metal oxide (BMO)” and “graphitic carbon nitride (CN)”. Perovskites are ceramic and they are hard materials so they could be a favorable candidate for solid-state hydrogen storage. g-C3N4 has attractive features including high surface area, chemical stability, small band gap, and low-cost synthesis methods but also has great potential as an electrode material for energy storage capacitors.

The latter encompass two classes of kinetics for adsorption/desorption and chemical reactions - fast and Marcelin-De Donder, and the second class includes mass action kinetics as a special case. We apply the framework to derive a system consisting of the standard diffusion equation in bulk and FitzHugh-Nagumo type surface reaction-diffusion system of equations on the boundary. We also study the linear stability of a homogeneous steady state in a spherical region and establish sufficient conditions for the occurrence of instabilities driven by surface diffusion.

!107,"Hydrogen energy is a very attractive option in dealing with the existing energy crisis. For the development of a hydrogen energy economy, hydrogen storage technology must be improved to over the storage limitations. Compared with traditional hydrogen storage technology, the prospect of hydrogen storage materials is broader. Among all types of hydrogen storage materials, solid hydrogen storage materials are most promising and have the most safety security. Solid hydrogen storage materials include high surface area physical adsorption materials and interstitial and non-interstitial hydrides. Among them, interstitial hydrides, also called intermetallic hydrides, are hydrides formed by transition metals or their alloys. The main alloy types are A2B, AB, AB2, AB3, A2B7, AB5, and BCC. A is a hydride that easily forms metal (such as Ti, V, Zr, and Y), while B is a non-hydride forming metal (such as Cr, Mn, and Fe). The development of intermetallic compounds as hydrogen storage materials is very attractive because their volumetric capacity is much higher (80-160 kgH2m-3) than the gaseous storage method and the liquid storage method in a cryogenic tank (40 and 71 kgH2m-3). Additionally, for hydrogen absorption and desorption reactions, the environmental requirements are lower than that of physical adsorption materials (ultra-low temperature) and the simplicity of the procedure is higher than that of non-interstitial hydrogen storage materials (multiple steps and a complex catalyst). In addition, there are abundant raw materials and diverse ingredients.

!109,"Hydrogen storage materials with high hydrogen capacity and low operating temperature had attracted intense interests for solid state hydrogen storage application. Sodium alanate (NaAlH4) with suitable thermodynamics and relatively high capacity was one of the most promising hydrogen storage materials for practical applications. However, high kinetic barriers induced high operating temperature, slow hydrogen release/uptake rate and poor reversibility. Considerable studies revealed that the addition of Ti-based catalysts could effectively improve its kinetic performance, consequently reducing the de-/hydrogenation temperature and enhancing the hydrogen storage reversibility. In this work, recent research progress of hydrogen storage properties of NaAlH4 modified by Ti-based catalysts was reviewed to guide the future development of this hydrogen storage system. First, the doping methods of Ti-based catalysts were introduced. After that, the improvement in hydrogen storage performance of NaAlH4 with various Ti-based catalysts was summarized and the corresponding catalytic mechanisms were elucidated. Finally, the future research direction of catalyst-modified NaAlH4 was discussed. It was well known that the addition process of catalysts was closely related to its existing state and distribution in metal hydride matrix, which affected the catalytic functions. High-energy ball milling treatment not only reduced the particle sizes of catalysts and NaAlH4 but also increased the uniform distribution of catalysts and intimate contact with NaAlH4 caused by energetic collision between milling balls. This facilitated the high catalytic activity. As a result, high-energy ball milling was the most frequently used and effective preparation strategy for catalyst-modified NaAlH4-based hydrogen storage materials. For optimizing catalysts, a variety of Ti-based compounds, including Ti-based organic compounds, halides, oxides and intermetallics, were studied and evaluated for their catalytic activity. Their effects on hydrogen storage behaviors of NaAlH4 were compared and the corresponding mechanisms were discussed and revealed. In particular, NaAlH4 catalyzed with ultrafine Ti nanoparticles supported on carbon displayed the best overall hydrogen storage properties. The usable hydrogen capacity remained at 5.07% and the on-set dehydrogenation temperature was reduced to 75℃. The dehydrogenated sample was fully hydrogenated within 3 min at 100℃ and 12.2 MPa of hydrogen pressure. More importantly, the capacity retention was as high as 98.6% after 100 cycles, which is quite favorable for practical applications. In addition, mechanistic studies revealed that high valent Ti-based compounds were reduced to low valent species and finally gave rise to the formation of Al-Ti or TiHx due to the strong reductivity of NaAlH4 during ball milling and initial dehydrogenation/hydrogenation cycling. The Al-Ti or TiHx species work as the actual active catalysts to promote the breaking and recombination of Al-H bonding. This was the most important reason for the reduced operating temperatures of dehydrogenation/hydrogenation. The key role played by Ti-based catalysts in the reduction of kinetic energy barriers for hydrogen release from NaAlH4 was further confirmed by theoretical calculations. The future studies should mainly focus on the synergistic effects of nanostructing and nano-catalysis to further improve the overall hydrogen storage properties of NaAlH4 materials. © Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Rare Metals.

!119,"As a potential hydrogen storage material for solid hydrogen storage, the binary hydride MgH2 had the advantages of high hydrogen storage density and reversible hydrogen absorption and desorption. However, the applications of MgH2 were restricted due to the slow rate of hydrogen absorption and desorption, and the high working temperature. To date, in order to meet the requirements of solid hydrogen storage materials for vehicular hydrogen storage, many methods to improve the hydrogen storage performance of MgH2 were developed by scientific researchers such as alloying, nanocrystallization, and catalyst doping. These methods reduced the hydrogen desorption temperature of the system, increased the hydrogen absorption and desorption cycle stability. Among them, catalyst doping was the most extensively studied one, and it was considered to be a very effective way to improve the performance of magnesium-based hydrogen storage. A mechanical ball milling process was used to add the catalyst. During the ball milling process, the catalyst might react with the magnesium hydride in a solid state. Ball milling was a very important method of structural modification. It could not only conveniently control the composition of the alloy, but also could directly obtain materials with metastable structures such as nanocrystalline, amorphous and supersaturated solid solutions. In this method, metals (such as Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, etc.), metal compounds (such as Nb2O5, CeO2, TMTiO3 (TM=Ni, Co), etc.), transition metal halides (such as CeF4, CeF3, LaCl3, etc.), carbon-based materials (such as graphite, graphene, AC, CFs, etc.), metal-based and carbon-based composites were used as catalysts, and added single or in combination to magnesium-based alloys by mechanical ball milling. The research results showed that transition metals had a strong affinity for hydrogen atoms. During the dissociation of hydrogen molecules or the recombination of hydrogen atoms, the d electrons of transition metals and the electrons on the hydrogen atom/hydrogen molecular orbital were transferred and filled, which resulted in the interaction forces to promote the dissociation of hydrogen molecules and the recombination of hydrogen atoms. At the same time, after the metal catalyst was doped, many defects were generated on the surface of MgH2, which were conducive to charge and heat transfer. Furthermore, the metal oxides were cheap and easy to prepare. Doping transition metal oxides could effectively catalyze the hydrogen absorption and desorption reaction of MgH2. It could also be used as a lubricant and dispersant during the grinding process to prevent the agglomeration of MgH2 particles and refine the size of MgH2 particles, accelerate the hydrogen desorption kinetics of MgH2, catalyze the hydrogen absorption and desorption reaction of MgH2. Transition metal halides could react with MgH2 in the process of hydrogen absorption and desorption to generate transition metal hydrides. These transition metal hydrides could promote the dissociation of hydrogen molecules and the diffusion of hydrogen atoms, promote nucleation and reduction in the hydrogenation process. The reaction product of metal sulfide or metal hydride and MgH2 in the ball milling process had high catalytic activity, which could solve the problem of slow dehydrogenation/hydrogenation kinetics to a certain extent. In addition, MgS could provide abundant nucleation active sites, and Fe element could stabilize MgH2. LaF3 could react with Mg to form MgF2 and LaH3 phases during hydrogenation ball milling, which significantly increased the amount and rate of hydrogen desorption of magnesium. The catalytic mechanism was that LaH3 acted as a hydrogen pump. The addition of carbon-based materials could promote the nucleation of the Mg/MgH2 phase, refine the particle size, and improve the hydrogen absorption kinetics. Unfortunately, the effect was weaker than that of metal-based catalysts. Doped with metal-based and carbon-based composite catalysts, MgH2 could simultaneously obtain the effects of doped metal-based and carbon-based catalysts, such as the low dehydrogenation temperature, low dehydrogenation activation energy and excellent cycle stability. It could be seen that doped metal-based catalysts could generally promote the formation and decomposition of MgH2 bonds by generating a large number of defects or new phases, and then enhancing the dehydrogenation/hydrogenation kinetics of the hydrogen storage material system. Carbon-based materials doped with non-metals could effectively prevent MgH2 particles from agglomeration and grain growth during the ball milling process. In addition, its low density could maintain the high hydrogen storage capacity of MgH2 materials. In order to meet the practical standard, it was necessary to develop new technology and find new experimental methods. One of the important strategies to improve the hydrogen storage performance of MgH2 was synergistic utilization of metal-based materials and carbon-based materials as catalysts. To carry out composite catalysis research and to study the synergistic effect of different catalysts could help to improve the hydrogen storage performance of MgH2. With the help of simulation calculation or first principles, the mechanism of chemical reaction of MgH2 in the process of hydrogen absorption and desorption after catalyst doping could be further clarified.

The cooling chamber, although producing minor leaks due to design oversight, increased performance dramatically, showing a reduction in internal powder temperature from 130°C, down to 25°C during the absorption process, as well as reducing the absorption time down from 30 minutes to just over 5 minutes.

The effect of PdCl2 on the hydrogenation properties including kinetics of Mg/MgH2 has been investigated in the present study. The nanocomposites of Mg and PdCl2 were prepared using Ball Mill method with different concentrations of PdCl2. The synthesized nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), pressure-composition-isotherm (PCI) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

!128,"Rapid scale-up of the technologies for clean energy production, conversion and storage have been adopted by many countries in order to reduce demand for fossil fuels. Primary renewable energy such as solar, wind, and hydro are developed for energy production particularly for electricity generation. However, there are still some deficiencies in direct use of primary renewable energy sources; therefore, secondary energy sources (or carriers) have been recently established as clean energy sources. Hydrogen is a type of secondary energy sources with almost low density and light weight; therefore, it must be stored in the form of liquid or gas. The storage of hydrogen in the form of liquid requires very low temperature. Solid-state hydrogen storage on the surfaces of solids or within solids is a promising solution to above shortcomings for high-density energy storage. Herein, multi-layers solid-state materials with ability of hydrogen adsorption are presented, for the first time, including “mixed metal oxide (MMO) nanostructures” and “silicate layers”. The MMO is CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanostructures which synthesized via Pechini method in front of various chelating agents such as trimesic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, and malonic acid, while the silicate layer is nanoclay montmorillonite K10. In this study, the experimental observations reveal a pure formation of CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanostructures in malonic acid at 500 °C, with almost regular nanosized morphology of 20–25 nm. The selected sample is then used for nanocomposite formation by dispersing the CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanostructures into the montmorillonite K10 solution.

However, the dehydrogenation of MgH2 generally happens at temperatures above 250 °C even after catalyzing and/or nano-confining modifications, thus embarrassing the practical use of MgH2 in fuel cells. NH4Cl is a cheap chemical which has mature synthesis technologies in large industrial productions. The protonic H (Hδ+) in NH4Cl and the hydridic H (Hδ−) in MgH2 have coulomb interaction which allow MgH2 to release hydrogen at milder temperatures.

LiAlH4, as a solid-state hydrogen storage material, presents several advantages such as high hydrogen storage capacity, low price and abundant sources. Unfortunately, neither thermodynamic nor kinetic properties of dehydrogenation for LiAlH4 can fulfill the requirements of practical application. Thus, a series of spinel ferrite nanoparticles such as XFe2O4 (X = Ni, Co, Mn, Cu, Zn, Fe) were prepared by using the modified thermal decomposition method, and then doped into LiAlH4 by using ball milling. Our results show that LiAlH4 doped with 7 wt% NiFe2O4 starts to release hydrogen at 69.1 °C, and the total amount of hydrogen released is 7.29 wt% before 300 °C.

!139,"Hydrogen has the highest gravimetric density (energy density per unit mass) of any fuel. The combustion of hydrogen releases energy in the form of heat. When hydrogen reacts with oxygen in a fuel cell, the reaction releases energy in the form of electricity. Unlike hydrocarbon-based fuels, the generation of energy from either the combustion of hydrogen or the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell is not accompanied by the emission of greenhouse gases. This makes hydrogen a promising solution to solve global warming issues. However, hydrogen has a low volumetric density (low energy density per unit volume) which makes storing or transporting hydrogen extremely difficult and expensive. To accelerate the utilization of hydrogen as an energy carrier, it is necessary to develop advanced hydrogen storage methods that have the potential to have a higher energy density. The hydrogen storage market is segmented by application into: (1) Stationary power: stored hydrogen is consumed for example in a fuel cell for use in backup power stations, refueling stations, power stations; (2) Portable power: hydrogen storage applications for electronic devices such as mobile phones, flash lights, and portable generators; and (3) Transportation: industries including automobiles, aerospace, unmanned aerial systems, and hydrogen tanks used throughout the hydrogen supply chain.

The current study presents a systematic approach for solving the activation issue (difficulty in the first hydrogenation), one of the major obstacles to the practical application of TiFe alloys, via the use of a secondary AB2 phase. Based on the Ti–Fe–Cr ternary phase diagram, Ti–Fe–Cr alloys containing 80 at% Ti(Fe,Cr) (AB phase) and 20 at% Ti(Fe,Cr)2 (AB2 phase) were designed; the Cr concentrations in the AB and AB2 phase were systematically varied while maintaining fixed phase fractions. Activation at RT was achieved when the overall Cr concentration was higher than 9.7 at%. Analysis of the activation characteristics of the individual phases revealed that the AB2 phase readily absorbed hydrogen, thereby initiating activation of AB + AB2 alloys. Notably, higher Cr concentrations enable the AB phase to absorb hydrogen at RT during the activation process, although the kinetics are much slower than that of the co-existing AB2 phase. The equilibrium hydrogen pressures from the pressure-composition isotherms decrease as the Cr concentration increases, indicating that Cr stabilizes hydrides. Increased hydride stability may also promote the kinetics of the initial hydride formation in both the AB and AB2 phases.

!141,"This paper aims at addressing the exploitation of solid-state carriers for hydrogen storage, with attention paid both to the technical aspects, through a wide review of the available integrated systems, and to the social aspects, through a preliminary overview of the connected impacts from a gender perspective. As for the technical perspective, carriers to be used for solid-state hydrogen storage for various applications can be classified into two classes: metal and complex hydrides. Related crystal structures and corresponding hydrogen sorption properties are reviewed and discussed. Fundamentals of thermodynamics of hydrogen sorption evidence the key role of the enthalpy of reaction, which determines the operating conditions (i.e., temperatures and pressures). In addition, it rules the heat to be removed from the tank during hydrogen absorption and to be delivered to the tank during hydrogen desorption. Suitable values for the enthalpy of hydrogen sorption reaction for operating conditions close to ambient (i.e., room temperature and 1–10 bar of hydrogen) are close to 30 kJ·molH2−1 . The kinetics of the hydrogen sorption reaction is strongly related to the microstructure and to the morphology (i.e., loose powder or pellets) of the carriers. Usually, the kinetics of the hydrogen sorption reaction is rather fast, and the thermal management of the tank is the rate-determining step of the processes. As for the social perspective, the paper arguments that, as it occurs with the exploitation of other renewable innovative technologies, a wide consideration of the social factors connected to these processes is needed to reach a twofold objective: To assess the extent to which a specific innovation might produce positive or negative impacts in the recipient socioeconomic system and, from a sociotechnical perspective, to explore the potential role of the social components and dynamics in fostering the diffusion of the innovation itself. Within the social domain, attention has been paid to address the underexplored relationship between the gender perspective and the enhancement of hydrogen-related energy storage systems.

Among the solid-state H2 storage materials, borohydride is a potential candidate for H2 storage owing to its high gravimetric capacity (majority borohydride materials release >10 wt% of H2 ). Mg(BH4 )2, which is included in the borohydride family, shows promise as a good H2 storage material owing to its high gravimetric capacity (14.9 wt%). However, its practical application is hindered by high thermal decomposition temperature (above 300◦ C), slow sorption kinetics and poor reversibility. Currently, the general research on the use of additives to enhance the H2 storage performance of Mg(BH4 )2 is still under investigation. This article reviews the latest research on additive-enhanced Mg(BH4 )2 and its impact on the H2 storage performance. The future prospect and challenges in the development of additive-enhanced Mg(BH4 )2 are also discussed in this review paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review paper that focuses on the additive-enhanced Mg(BH4 )2 for solid-state H2 storage. © 2022 by the authors.

Herein, V4Nb18O55 microspheres composed of nanoparticles with size of tens of nanometers are fabricated to promote H2 desorption and absorption properties of MgH2, which results in the uniform formation of Nb/V interfaces based on a molecular scale during the reversible hydrogen storage process. It is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated that the uniform building of Nb/V interfaces not only preserves the ability of Nb in weakening Mg-H bonds but also alleviates the strong adsorption capacity of metallic Nb toward hydrogen atoms, leading to a relative energy barrier for the whole dehydrogenation process of MgH2 of only 0.5 eV, which is 0.22 and 0.43 eV lower than that of Nb and V, respectively. As a result, under the addition of V4Nb18O55 microspheres, the onset H2 desorption temperature of MgH2 is decreased to 165 °C, 125 °C lower than that of bulk MgH2, and the complete hydrogenation of Mg could be realized even at room temperature, while almost no H2 adsorption is observed for bulk Mg at a high temperature of 50 °C. © 2022 The Authors.

!150,"Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is the best candidate material to store hydrogen in the solid-state form owing to its advantages such as good reversibility, high hydrogen storage capacity (7.6 wt%), low raw material cost and abundance in the earth. Nevertheless, slow desorption/absorption kinetics and high thermodynamic stability are two issues that have constrained the commercialization of MgH2 as a solid-state hydrogen storage material. So, to boost the desorption/absorption kinetics and to alter the thermodynamics of MgH2, hafnium tetrachloride (HfCl4) was used as a catalyst in this study. Different percentages of HfCl4 (5, 10, 15 and 20 wt%) were added to MgH2 and their catalytic influences on the hydrogen storage properties of MgH2 were investigated. Results showed that the 15 wt% HfCl4-doped MgH2 sample was the best composite to enhance the hydrogen storage performance of MgH2. The onset decomposition temperature of the 15 wt% HfCl4-doped MgH2 composite was decreased by ~75 °C compared to as-milled MgH2. Meanwhile, the desorption/absorption kinetic measurements showed an improvement compared to the undoped MgH2. From the Kissinger analysis, the apparent dehydrogenation activation energy was 167.0 kJ/mol for undoped MgH2 and 102.0 kJ/mol for 15 wt% HfCl4-doped MgH2. This shows that the HfCl4 addition reduced the activation energy of the hydrogen decomposition of MgH2. The desorption enthalpy change calculated by the van't Hoff equation showed that the addition of HfCl4 to MgH2 did not affect the thermodynamic properties. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the size of the MgH2 particles decreased and there was less agglomeration after the addition of HfCl4. It is believed that the decrease in the particle size and in-situ generated MgCl2 and Hf-containing species had synergistic catalytic effects on enhancing the hydrogen storage properties of the HfCl4-doped MgH2 composite. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is the best candidate material to store hydrogen in the solid-state form owing to its advantages such as good reversibility, high hydrogen storage capacity (7.6 wt%), low raw material cost and abundance in the earth.

The most viable clean, green and alternative energy carrier is hydrogen that can meet out the challenges posed towards energy scarcity. So, the present work focus on the effective storing of hydrogen on non-carboneous (Ah-BN) and hydrogen rich metal hydride (NaBH4) based storage medium. where a facile chemical impregnated method was adopted for the preparation of NaBH4/Ah-BN nanocomposite. The structural, morphological, elemental composition and specific surface area analysis of the prepared NaBH4/Ah-BN nanocomposite confirms the presence of NaBH4 wrapped around Ah-BN and enhanced specific surface area of 154.4 m2 g −1 (NaBH4/Ah-BN) from 68.2 m2 g −1 (Ah-BN). The presence of NaBH4 not only increases the specific surface area but also increases the pore volume thereby creating more defects. In contrast the presence of Ah-BN drastically reduces the decomposition temperature of NaBH4. The amount of stored hydrogen (Sievert's-like hydrogenation setup) was 3.8 wt% at 119 °C and the binding energy falls in the recommended range (0.33 −0.50 eV) of US-Department of Energy (DOE) 2025 targets. All the thermal analysis [thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)] ensures the two-step dehydrogenation for NaBH4/Ah-BN.

Using the high-capacity hydrogen storage candidate LiAlH4 as an exemplar, we demonstrate an alternative approach to the thermodynamic stabilization of metastable metal hydrides by coordination to nitrogen binding sites within the nanopores of N-doped CMK-3 carbon (NCMK-3). The resulting LiAlH4@NCMK-3 material releases H2 at temperatures as low as 126 °C with full decomposition below 240 °C, bypassing the usual Li3AlH6 intermediate observed in bulk. Moreover, >80% of LiAlH4 can be regenerated under 100 MPa H2, a feat previously thought to be impossible. Nitrogen sites are critical to these improvements, as no reversibility is observed with undoped CMK-3. Density functional theory predicts a drastically reduced Al-H bond dissociation energy and supports the observed change in the reaction pathway.

!163,"Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is one of the most promising materials for solid state hydrogen storage, but overly stable thermodynamics and sluggish kinetics of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation hinders its application. In this study, Mg90Al10 was prepared by hydriding combustion synthesis (HCS), and then various Ti-based compounds (Ti, TiH2, TiO2 and TiF3) were introduced into Mg90Al10 by ball milling. Mg90Al10 + 10 wt% TiF3 displays the most excellent dehydrogenation property compared with those doped with other Ti-based compounds. For instance, due to the addition of 10 wt% TiF3, the peak dehydrogenation temperature and the apparent dehydrogenation activation energy of the composite are 86 °C and 77.1 kJ/mol lower than those of Mg90Al10 (364 °C and 155.95 kJ/mol). In addition, the catalytic effect of TiF3 on the hydrogen storage properties of Mg90Al10 has been investigated in detail. Except for the unreacted TiF3, Al3Ti and MgF2 can be found during the first dehydrogenation process and remain stable in the subsequent de/hydrogenation cycles, which can act as the active sites to accelerate the hydrogen dissociation and recombination. Therefore, the excellent hydrogen storage properties of Mg90Al10 + 10 wt% TiF3 can be attributed to the catalytic effect of TiF3, in-situ formed Al3Ti and MgF2.

!164,"The development of efficient and low-cost solid-state hydrogen storage materials remains a significant challenge. Carbonaceous-based nanostructures supported with metal catalysts have shown promising results toward hydrogen storage. Here, we report on a facile one-pot synthesis of a novel three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and expanded graphite (EG) nanocomposite (NC) decorated with Pd nanoparticles (NPs) as hydrogen storage media. The effects of the electrochemically active surface area and surface oxygen groups of the as-synthesized Pd/rGO-EG on electrochemical hydrogen uptake and release were investigated in detail. For comparison, five Pd/rGO-EG NCs with rGO/EG mass ratios of 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 were prepared. All the Pd/rGO-EG NCs exhibited a much higher hydrogen storage capacity than Pd/rGO and Pd/EG. Among them, Pd/rGO-EG(1:1) showed the highest hydrogen uptake and release (9850 mC cm-2 mg-1), which was over six- and twofold increase compared to Pd/rGO (1480 mC cm-2 mg-1) and Pd/EG (4290 mC cm-2 mg-1), respectively. The synergistic effects of the rGO-EG NC could be attributed to the formation of the 3D graphene-based structure, a minimal degree of sheet stacking, and homogeneous Pd NP dispersion. The formed Pd/rGO-EG NC possessed significant interfacial active sites, thereby greatly enhancing its performance for hydrogen uptake and release. The influence of the applied electrode potential on the formation of α-phase and β-phase nucleation in the as-synthesized materials was further investigated.

!165,"Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is considered as a promising solid-state hydrogen storage material due to its high hydrogen storage mass density and environmental friendliness. However, its sluggish dehydrogenation kinetics are still the bottleneck that restricts practical applications. To address this challenge, very recent pioneering experiments found that MgH2/single-atom catalyst (MgH2/SAC) heterojunctions can be promising candidates for hydrogen storage. However, the reaction mechanism and design guideline were still not well understood. Herein, we design and analyze MgH2/SAC heterojunction systems including nine 3d transition metals, using spin-polarized density functional theory calculations with van der Waals corrections. We found that the energy barriers of MgH2 dehydrogenation are significantly reduced by 0.51-2.22 eV through the promotion effects of a heterojunction. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, these promotion effects were analyzed in depth based on the observation of hydrogen diffusion behaviors. To provide further insights, the electron localization function, charge density difference, hydrogen adsorption energy, system electronegativity, d-band center, and crystal orbital Hamilton population were comprehensively analyzed to understand the origin of the high performance of MgH2/SACs. In particular, we found that the system electronegativity of SACs can act as an effective descriptor that predicts the dehydrogenation energy barriers. Most importantly, this study provides important design guidelines of a brand-new type of MgH2/SAC material and a promising solution to the sluggish kinetics of MgH2 dehydrogenation in hydrogen storage. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Herein, we design and analyze MgH2/SAC heterojunction systems including nine 3d transition metals, using spin-polarized density functional theory calculations with van der Waals corrections.

!166,"This paper studies on the preparation of the alanate-borohydride combined system, LiAlH4 + Mg(BH4)2 with diverse molar ratios (1:1, 1:2, and 2:1) using the ball milling technique. The findings show that there is a mutual destabilization between the hydrides where the newly combined system has superior hydrogen storage performances as opposed to the unary components (LiAlH4 and Mg[BH4]2). Analysis on the initial decomposition temperature and isothermal de/hydrogenation kinetics has proven that the 2LiAlH4 + Mg(BH4)2 system possesses better performance. In an endeavor to ameliorate the performances of the hydrogen storage of 2LiAlH4 + Mg(BH4)2, the destabilized system was doped with TiF3. Three major steps of desorption were detected during the heating process in the 2LiAlH4 + Mg(BH4)2 system with and without the addition of TiF3, which are correlated to the decomposition of Mg(AlH4)2, MgH2 and LiBH4. It is found that 2LiAlH4 + Mg(BH4)2 + 5 wt.% TiF3 has decreased the initial decomposition temperature at about 60°C, which is 55°C lower than the non-catalyzed 2LiAlH4 + Mg(BH4)2 system. The isothermal absorption/desorption kinetics of the 2LiAlH4 + Mg(BH4)2 system have also been enhanced by the addition of TiF3. The activation energy for Mg(AlH4)2-, MgH2-, and LiBH4-relevant decomposition after doped 2LiAlH4 + Mg(BH4)2 with TiF3 are reduced to 36.5, 23.3, and 17.6 kJ mol−1. Studies on the structural characteristics analysis of the 2LiAlH4 + Mg(BH4)2 + TiF3 sample hint to the fact that the formation of the MgF2, LiF, TiH2 and Ti-Al species, during desorption, is the main responsible factor for the observed thermodynamics change of the reactions by modifying the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation pathway.

!167,"Hydrogen storage and delivery technology is still a bottleneck in the hydrogen industry chain. Among all kinds of hydrogen storage methods, light-weight solid-state hydrogen storage (LSHS) materials could become promising due to its intrinsic high hydrogen capacity. Hydrolysis reaction of LSHS materials occurs at moderate conditions, indicating the potential for portable applications. At present, most of review work focuses on the improvement of material performance, especially the catalysts design. This part is important, but the others, such as operation modes, are also vital to to make full use of material potential in the practical applications. Different operation modes of hydrolysis reaction have an impact on hydrogen capacity to various degrees. For example, hydrolysis in solution would decrease the hydrogen capacity of hydrogen generator to a low value due to the excessive water participating in the reaction. Therefore, application-oriented operation modes could become a key problem for hydrolysis reaction of LSHS materials. In this paper, the operation modes of hydrolysis reaction and their practical applications are mainly reviewed. The implements of each operation mode are discussed and compared in detail to determine the suitable one for practical applications with the requirement of high energy density.

This lacuna is a critical barrier in developing efficacious hydrogen storage reactors for various applications. This article chronicles the 3-D design and optimization of three basic heat exchanger setups of solid-state hydrogen storage systems (shell and tube, spiral tube, and tubular) on critical parameters. For 5 kg LaNi5, a tubular design with small tube diameters has resulted in a shorter reaction time (120 s) for 90% saturation at 303 K and 15 bar inlet conditions; however, the reactor's gravimetric density was exceptionally high. In contrast, the reactor with three spiral tubes accomplished an exemplary reaction rate at a reasonable gravimetric density. This spiral arrangement became the base for developing a novel reactor that integrated heat pipes to reduce the sorption time. The proposed design achieved a specific output energy rate of 527 W/kg for 90% saturation in 366 s at a supply pressure of 15 bar, which is 23.7% higher than the reactor without heat pipes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","This lacuna is a critical barrier in developing efficacious hydrogen storage reactors for various applications.

!169,"Lithium alanate (LiAlH4) is a material that can be potentially used for solid-state hydrogen storage due to its high hydrogen content (10.5 wt%). Nevertheless, a high desorption temperature, slow desorption kinetic, and irreversibility have restricted the application of LiAlH4 as a solid-state hydrogen storage material. Hence, to lower the decomposition temperature and to boost the dehydrogenation kinetic, in this study, we applied K2NiF6 as an additive to LiAlH4. The addition of K2NiF6 showed an excellent improvement of the LiAlH4 dehydrogenation properties. After adding 10 wt% K2NiF6, the initial decomposition temperature of LiAlH4 within the first two dehydrogenation steps was lowered to 90 °C and 156 °C, respectively, that is 50 °C and 27 °C lower than that of the аs-milled LiAlH4. In terms of dehydrogenation kinetics, the dehydrogenation rate of K2NiF6-doped LiAlH4 sample was significantly higher as compared to аs-milled LiAlH4. The K2NiF6-doped LiAlH4 sample can release 3.07 wt% hydrogen within 90 min, while the milled LiAlH4 merely release 0.19 wt% hydrogen during the same period. According to the Arrhenius plot, the apparent activation energies for the desorption process of K2NiF6-doped LiAlH4 are 75.0 kJ/mol for the first stage and 88.0 kJ/mol for the second stage. These activation energies are lower compared to the undoped LiAlH4. The morphology study showed that the LiAlH4 particles become smaller and less agglomerated when K2NiF6 is added. The in situ formation of new phases of AlNi and LiF during the dehydrogenation process, as well as a reduction in particle size, is believed to be essential contributors in improving the LiAlH4 dehydrogenation characteristics. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","These activation energies are lower compared to the undoped LiAlH4.

!170,"As classical BCC structure solid state hydrogen storage materials, vanadium-based solid solution alloys occupied a prominent position in the field of hydrogen storage materials due to their significant advantages such as the ability to absorb and desorb hydrogen with high capacity under moderate conditions. In this paper, RE-containing medium entropy BCC solid solution alloys were designed. The microstructure, phase composition and hydrogen storage properties of the medium entropy alloys were systematically studied. Microstructural analysis showed that nanoscale crystals were found in as-cast medium entropy alloys obtained by arc melting followed by natural cooling inside the furnace. This is different from the vanadium-based alloys that are often regarded as traditional coarse-grained alloys in the past decades. The V47Fe11Ti30Cr10RE2 alloys can be fully activated by one cycle of hydrogen ab/de-sorption after pretreatment. The kinetic test shows that the time required for the as-cast RE-containing medium entropy alloys hydrogen uptake to 90% saturation is less than 100 s at room temperature. The alloys exhibit very excellent hydrogen absorption kinetic properties than reported alloys takes at least about 300 s. This is due to the fact that the present alloys are composed of nanocrystals with numerous interfaces and grain boundaries, and these defects can act as good channels for the diffusion of hydrogen atoms. The V47Fe11Ti30Cr10Y2 alloy exhibits a maximum capacity of 3.41 wt% at 295 K.

The flakes are cycled 1000 times at 330 °C under 30/1 bar H2 for the absorption/desorption processes. The hydrogen storage capacity is maintained throughout the cycling: 5.09, 4.46 and 3.49 wt% H2 for Ni16.3, Ni11.3 and Ni4.4 (at%), respectively. No significant microstructural change is observed, indicating the excellent stability of the alloys at elevated temperatures.

An attempt is made to estimate the dehydrogenation activation energy of Ni16.3, and the calculated value seems comparable to that obtained for an early cycling stage (10 cycles).

The monthly and annual performance of the microgrid is studied for diverse climatic conditions with five climatic zones across six Indian locations as example.

!176,"This article reports the hydrogenation properties of a TiFe0.85Cr0.15 alloy prepared by gas atomization on one hand, and vacuum arc-remelting on the other hand for demonstration and reference, respectively. To evidence the excellent potential of ternary alloying combined with gas atomization process for improving the first hydrogen absorption kinetics, both the atomized powders and the reference crushed ingots were exposed to air from 1 h to as long as 10 days. In spite of the resulting surface oxide layer formation, all specimens still absorbed hydrogen partly thanks to the presence of the C14 Laves phase. As expected, the first hydrogenation kinetics decreased with increasing air-exposure time, but atomized powders not only outperformed the reference counterparts but also remained quite competitive despite surface oxidation. The remarkable kinetic enhancement observed was attributed to the formation of an additional Ti2Fe phase, to an increased amount of C14 Laves phase, as well as to a fine microstructure resulting from the rapid cooling rate involved in gas atomization.

A nanoparticle (NP) design, where γ-MgH2 forms intrinsically during hydrogenation is presented and a formation mechanism based on transmission electron microscopy results is proposed. Volume expansion during hydrogenation causes compressive stress within the confined, anisotropic NPs, leading to plastic deformation of β-MgH2 via (301)β twinning.

Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) has been widely applied as a potential solid-state hydrogen storage material.

The regeneration of NaBH4 from NaBO2 could significantly reduce the cost of NaBH4 and enable its wide-spread industrial use. In this work, we demonstrate a simple method for regenerating NaBH4 from NaBO2·4H2O using Mg2N3, which combines NaBH4 production with NH3 gas production in a single step at room temperature. NaBH4 is successfully synthesized from NaBO2·4H2O using the Mg3N2 reducing agent via ball milling under a hydrogen atmosphere. NaBH4 is formed at a 76.6% yield by planetary ball milling at 600 rpm under 40 bar hydrogen for 12 h. NH3 gas is also formed, which can be easily separated from the solid products.

However, a harsh activation procedure, slow hydrogenation/dehydrogenation process, and a high temperature for dehydrogenation prevent the use of Mg-based metal hydrides for practical applications. For these reasons, Mg-based alloys for hydrogen storage systems are generally alloyed with other elements to improve hydrogen sorption properties. In this article, we have added Na to cast Mg–La alloys and achieved a significant improvement in hydrogen absorption kinetics during the first activation cycle. The role of Na in Mg–La has been discussed based on the findings from microstructural observations, crystallography, and first principles calculations based on density functional theory. From our results in this study, we have found that the Na doped surface of Mg–La alloy systems have a lower adsorption energy for H2 compared to Na-free surfaces which facilitates adsorption and dissociation of hydrogen molecules leading to improvement of absorption kinetic.

However, fully mapping the stabilities of known or newly targeted compounds relative to competing phases at reaction conditions has previously required many stringent experiments or computationally demanding calculations of each compound's change in Gibbs energy with respect to temperature, G(T). In this work, we have extended the approach of constructing chemical potential phase diagrams based on ΔGf(T) to enable the analysis of phase stability at non-zero temperatures. We first performed density functional theory calculations to compute the formation enthalpies of binary, ternary, and quaternary compounds within several compositional spaces of current interest for solid-state hydrogen storage. Temperature effects on solid compound stability were then accounted for using our recently introduced machine learned descriptor for the temperaturedependent contribution Gδ(T) to the Gibbs energy G(T). From these Gibbs energies, we evaluated each compound's stability relative to competing compounds over a wide range of conditions and show using chemical potential and composition phase diagrams that the predicted stable phases and H2 release reactions are consistent with experimental observations. This demonstrates that our approach rapidly computes the thermochemistry of hydrogen release reactions for compounds at sufficiently high accuracy relative to experiment to provide a powerful framework for analyzing hydrogen storage materials.

The synthesis and development of materials with great potential for hydrogen storage is still a challenge in research and needs to be addressed to store hydrogen economically and efficiently. Various solid-state materials have been fabricated for hydrogen energy storage; however, carbon-based nanocomposites have gained more attention because of its high surface area, low processing cost, and light weight nature. Carbon materials are easy to modify with various metals, metal oxides (MOs), and other organometallic frameworks because of the functional groups available on the surface and edges that increase the storage capacity of hydrogen. In addition, chemisorption is another way to enhance the hydrogen storage capacity of carbon-based nanocomposites.

Various compositions of catalysts (eg, metal, MOs, alloy, metal organic frameworks) and carbon materials are designed for hydrogen storage.

!198,"Mg(BH4)2 is a promising solid-state hydrogen storage material, releasing 14.9 wt% hydrogen upon conversion to MgB2. The rehydrogenation of MgB2 is particularly challenging, requiring prolonged exposure to high pressures of hydrogen at high temperature. Here we report an XPS study probing the influence of LiH and TiH2 on the hydrogen storage properties of MgB2 in the surface and near-surface regions, as a complementary investigation to a preceding study of the bulk properties. Surface and near-surface properties are important considerations for nanoscale and bulk hydrogen storage materials. If there are reactions occurring at the surface that modify the chemical composition in the near-surface region, species diffusion can alter the chemical composition even deep into the bulk of the material. For LiH/MgB2, metastable LiH–B and LiH–Mg species are produced that are more reactive than Bulk MgB2. With prolonged glovebox storage, the LiH/MgB2 material shows increased reactivity towards O and C and enriched levels of Li and B in the near-surface region. In addition, Li induces the growth of Li2CO3 in the surface and near surface regions. Exposing LiH/MgB2 to hydrogen at 700 bar and 280 °C for 24 h produces borohydride at a temperature 100 °C below the threshold for bulk MgB2 hydrogenation. In a specifically surface process with macroscopic implications, the hydrogenation conditions also cause Li2CO3 to react with boron hydroxide in the sample to form a Li-deficient glassy lithium borate melt at the interfaces of the particles, bonding them together. Subsequent heating to 380 °C dehydrogenates the borohydride and eliminates the Li-deficient glassy lithium borate. The LiH/MgB2 material is not reversible because desorption does not lead back to LiH/MgB2, but rather to elemental B and Mg metal in the near-surface region. In contrast to LiH, TiH2 does not react with MgB2, despite the favorable thermodynamics for destabilization via TiB2 formation. Furthermore, high pressure hydrogenation yields only unreacted TiH2 and MgB2 in the surface and near-surface regions. Thus, added TiH2 provides no benefit to MgB2 hydrogenation, in agreement with the findings of the preceding bulk study. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","The LiH/MgB2 material is not reversible because desorption does not lead back to LiH/MgB2, but rather to elemental B and Mg metal in the near-surface region.

Here, using such processed samples, a comprehensive analysis of the sorption properties reveals that the first hydrogenation sequence significantly depends on the forging temperature, through different microstructures. More in detail, no phase transformation occurs upon cold forging, while solid-state reaction leads to the formation of the Mg2Ni intermetallic compound upon forging above 400 °C. Forging below the brittle-to-ductile transition (225-250 °C) leads to faster H2 uptake upon first absorption owing to a more textured fiber along the c-axis and internal strains which promote hydrogen diffusion through the bulk material. Desorption kinetics remain slower with low-temperature forging, despite Ni recombining to form Mg2Ni during the first desorption. After several cycles, a two-step behavior is observed with a fast absorption step occurring up to about 3 wt.%. Despite this limited uptake performance, the forging process can be considered as a straightforward, safe, and cost-efficient process to produce large amounts of Mg-based alloys for hydrogen storage.

Samples were crushed in a rolling mill producing slightly deformed pieces within the millimeter range size, which were processed by ECR with 40 or 80 passes. Part of undeformed fragments was used for comparison purposes. All samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffractometry, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, hydrogen volumetry, and differential scanning calorimetry. After ECR, samples deformed with 40 passes were formed by thick sheets, while several thin layers composed the specimens after 80 passages. Furthermore, deformation of β Ti–40Nb alloys synthesized samples containing a high density of crystalline defects, cracks, and stored strain energy that increased with the deformation amount and proportionally helped to overcome the diffusion's control mechanisms, thus improving kinetic behaviors at low temperature. Such an improvement was also correlated to the synergetic effect of resulting features after deformation and thickness of stacked layers in the different deformation conditions. At the room temperature, samples deformed with 80 passes absorbed ∼2.0 wt% of H2 after 15 min, while samples deformed with 40 passes absorbed ∼1.8 wt% during 2 h, excellent results if compared with undeformed samples hydrogenated at 300 °C that acquired a capacity of ∼1.7 wt% after 2 h.

With the addition of 10 wt% Mn3O4 nanoparticles, the MgH2-Mn3O4 composite started to release hydrogen at 200 °C and approximately 6.8 wt% H2 could be released within 8 min at 300 °C.

!212,"We have investigated the structure and hydrogen storage properties of a series of quaternary and quintary high-entropy alloys related to the ternary system TiVNb with powder X-ray diffraction (PXD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and manometric measurements in a Sieverts apparatus. The alloys have body-centred cubic (bcc) crystal structures and form face-centred cubic (fcc) metal hydrides with hydrogen-to-metal ratios close to 2 by hydrogenation. The onset temperature for hydrogen desorption, Tonset, decreases linearly with the valence-electron concentration, VEC. Moreover, the volumetric expansion per metal atom from the bcc alloys to the fcc hydrides, [(V/Z)fcc−(V/Z)bcc]/(V/Z)bcc, increases linearly with the VEC. Therefore, it seems that a larger expansion of the lattice destabilizes the metal hydrides and that this effect can be tuned by altering the VEC. Kissinger analyses performed on the DSC measurements indicate that the destabilization is a thermodynamic rather than kinetic effect.

The detailed analysis of electron microscopic investigation of the film structure at all growth stages (from 5 nm to 1 μm) is provided. It is shown how the bombardment with gas ions during the film deposition contributes to a formation of intergranular nanopores. The size of nanopores and their distribution were determined by means of neutron spectroscopy analysis. Using the nuclear-physical methods, the total volume of intergranular pores was measured and it was shown that, depending on the parameters of the IBAD process, the porosity can vary from 10 to 27 vol. %.

Using experimental and first-principles calculations approaches, we, for the first time, investigate the catalytic effect and mechanism of nickel phthalocyanine on the dehydrogenation properties of MgH2. The results display that a small amount of nickel phthalocyanine can promote MgH2 dehydrogenation at significantly decreased temperatures by more than 90 °C relative to milled pristine or graphene-added MgH2 system. However, the agglomeration of MgH2 particles is not evidently alleviated through nickel phthalocyanine addition. When MgH2 is milled with graphene firstly and then the obtained mixture is further milled with nickel phthalocyanine, the dehydrogenation properties and agglomeration of MgH2 particles can be synergistically improved to some extent. The first-principles calculations of dehydrogenation enthalpy and binding energy account for the experimental differences in catalysis and aggregation-resistance abilities of nickel phthalocyanine and graphene on MgH2 particles. Notably, the NiN4-inserted graphene is predicted to be an ideal additive for MgH2, which combines the synergetic catalysis-confinement effect of nickel phthalocyanine and graphene on MgH2 particles.

!228,"As important as the production of CO2-free energy is, so is the motivation to develop efficient storage of renewable energies for mobile and stationary applications. There is no doubt that metal hydrides continue to attract the overall materials science community, and it is not only restrained to a specialized hydrogen field. This is mainly the case when it is the matter of coupled technologies with other systems such as fuel cells, heat management, and batteries. Hydrogen is considered an energy carrier and its chemical energy can be converted into electricity through a chemical reaction with oxygen from a fuel cell. Therefore, coupling energy storage systems with renewable energy sources through an electrolyzer, which can transform electric energy into hydrogen chemical energy, is considered a high sustainable process of production and exploitation of renewable energies. Integrated systems are constituted by a metal hydride tank and a PEM fuel cell, in which the waste heat generated in the fuel cell is used to supply the necessary heat required for desorption of hydrogen from the tank. The field of application of the integrated power system is in combination with renewable sources: The hydrogen can be produced by electrolysis of water using the energy from a renewable source (e.g., photovoltaic); it is then stored and converted into electric energy by the proposed integrated power system, that allows energy storage in the form of hydrogen and its reuse when the renewable source is not available, for example, at night if solar power is exploited. The developed power system could replace batteries and could be applied in the case of a production plant not connected to the power grid, such as in remote areas. As an example, an integrated power system, showing a total energy production of 4.8 kW h, over more than 6 h of working activity, is reported in ref 4. In the SSH2S (Fuel Cell Coupled Solid-State Hydrogen Storage Tank) project, a solid-state hydrogen storage tank based on complex hydrides has been developed and it was fully integrated with a High-Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane (HT-PEM) fuel cell stack. The hydrogen storage tank was designed to feed a 1 kW HT-PEM stack for 2 h to be used for an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU).61 With respect to batteries, hydrides can be utilized as anodes with high capacity (e.g., 2 Ahg-1 for MgH2). A lot of effort has been expended to improve the cyclability, and significant results have been reached in a solid-state battery with LiBH4 solid electrolyte. Demonstration of high-energy density fuel cells with suitable cathodes will be the challenge of upcoming research studies.62,63 As mentioned for the beneficial contribution of electrodes, solid-state electrolytes based on borohydrides are a typical example that the battery community is now taking seriously along with the popular garnet-type solid electrolytes.64,65 It has been demonstrated that the ionic conductivity is a prerequisite for application in batteries, but unfortunately it is not win; in fact, other important issues need to be tackled, such as chemical compatibility, interfaces, heterogeneity, and mechanical properties, so important for the cell engineering and design, in addition to the structural and volumetric changes during cycling. At first, borohydrides meet some of these criteria regarding conductivity and ductility, (thermo)chemistry, and low-density materials. Future research might be directed to the understanding and assessment of interfaces and physical and mechanical properties of the selected solid-electrolyte and electrodes. The specificity of the application may become a determining aspect in the selection of the suitable configuration. Substantial research efforts are being conducted to study new approaches toward the utilization of borohydrides and closo-type complex hydrides in composites.66,67 Thanks to their ductility and ionic conductivity, borohydrides can be also employed as additives for binder-free solid-state batteries. Since the demonstration of LiBH4 thin film growth,68 this could be considered for mitigating the formation of dendrite and oxidation layers on the surface of lithium metal. Another direction is focused on the development of Mg2+ conducting solid electrolytes for application in Mg batteries, which offer higher volumetric capacity compared to lithium at low cost. At present, the technology can be only possible at high-T owing to the low ionic conductivity and Mg2+-ion mobility.69 In addition, metal hydrides can be utilized as optical hydrogen sensors for the detection of hydrogen at low pressure levels according to changes in the optical properties, which is a step forward regarding the increase of the safety for advanced hydrogenbased systems. Lastly, compared to the traditional conferences for hydrogen community (MH, E-MRS, Gordon, etc.) there no doubt that IRSEC is a particular place to meet scientists and experts in the African context undergoing full energy boom.

!229,"In addition to serving as an important energy carrier, hydrogen storage material also has the potential to be used as an effective solid reducing agent. This paper is concerned with the application of MgH2/MoS2 hydrogen storage materials to thiophene desulfurization through catalytic transfer hydrogenation. The hydrogen content of the as-prepared MgH2/MoS2 composites is determined to be 6.15 wt% with a dehydrogenation peak temperature of 402 °C. Taking MgH2 as hydrogen donor, thiophene hydrodesulfurization has taken place at atmospheric pressure and at the temperature lower than the onset desorption temperature, indicating that a coupling effect occurs between MgH2 decomposition and thiophene hydrogenation. It is further revealed that sulfur removal in thiophene under the studied condition preferentially proceeds via direct desulfurization (DDS) route. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations manifest that energy barriers of the minimum energy path for thiophene hydrodesulfurization are all <1.35 eV.

!232,"Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a promising solid-state hydrogen storage material because of its low toxicity, high environmental stability and release of high-purity hydrogen. Nevertheless, the practical application of NaBH4 is still hampered by its high desorption temperature and slow hydrogen exchange kinetics. Using experimental and first-principles calculations approaches, the dehydrogenation properties and modifying mechanisms of NaBH4+10 wt%graphene composite acquired by ball-milling are systematically investigated in this work. The results show that the graphene plays a cooperative catalysis–confinement effect on NaBH4. X-ray diffraction analysis displays that no new phases formed due to the mutual inertia between NaBH4 and graphene during ball-milling. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy observations show that the NaBH4 particles are significantly refined after graphene addition, which effectively restrains the agglomeration of NaBH4 particles. Thermogravimetry testing and mass spectrometry testing indicate that the onset dehydrogenation temperature of the NaBH4+10 wt%graphene composite is decreased by about 114 °C relative to the milled pristine NaBH4.

Among the studied compositions, 6Mg(NH2)2[sbnd]9LiH[sbnd]2LiBH4 showed the best hydrogen storage properties. The presence of 2 mol of LiBH4 improved the thermal behaviour of the 6Mg(NH2)2[sbnd]9LiH by lowering the dehydrogenation peak temperature nearly 25 °C and by reducing the apparent dehydrogenation activation energy of about 40 kJ/mol. Furthermore, this material exhibited fast dehydrogenation (10 min)and hydrogenation kinetics (3 min)and excellent cycling stability with a reversible hydrogen capacity of 3.5 wt % at isothermal 180 °C. Investigations on the reaction pathway indicated that the observed superior kinetic behaviour likely related to the formation of Li4(BH4)(NH2)3. Studies on the rate-limiting steps hinted that the sluggish kinetic behaviour of the 6Mg(NH2)2[sbnd]9LiH pristine material are attributed to an interface-controlled mechanism.

!236,"This work discusses the influence of different metal hydride storage bed configurations. The objective was to design and optimize a solid-state hydrogen storage for a nonpolluting mobility. A study of the absorption and desorption dynamics of a loose powder bed was performed first, followed by three different storage bed configurations: compacted Ti-Mn alloy powder, alternated Ti-Mn alloy compacts with stainless steel fins and compacted [Ti-Mn alloy/Stainless steel] powder mixture. A numerical model was developed to simulate the heat transfer and the hydrogen absorption and desorption rates. The alternation and compact mixture configurations gave better heat transfer efficiencies, absorption and desorption rates and increased hydrogen storage densities. Indeed, an efficient heat transfer (between the tank and its surrounding fluid), a tailored porosity of the metal hydride storage bed and the addition of high thermal conductivity materials allowed the overall storage performance to be improved. Thus, the required time for loading/unloading hydrogen was reduced drastically. The alternation configuration would offer the additional advantage of a simple, inexpensive and efficient recycling procedure. © 2019","This work discusses the influence of different metal hydride storage bed configurations.

!237,"The features of gas discharge and plasma sources based on Penning trap with metal hydride cathodes are presented. In such devices, metal hydrides fulfill the functions of both a cathode and the solid-state generator of working gas. Their advantages are high purity of gas injected (99.99 - 99.999%), along with the safety and compactness in storage. Hydrogen is injected (desorbed) locally under the influence of ion bombardment of metal hydride surface, which fact provides return coupling between the intensity of gas desorption and the parameters of gas discharge. The rate of sputtering for those materials by plasma ions significantly reduces as well as heat loads. Above effect is achieved due to the creation of protective gas target as a result of both the thermal decomposition of metal hydride and ion stimulated desorption. The feature of metal hydride cathode under the conditions of gas discharge is a decrease in the ionization potential of desorbed hydrogen by 0.3-0.5 eV due to the molecules desorption in the vibrationally/rotationally excited state. This permits a substantially increase in ionization efficiency and the formation of negative ions by the mechanism of dissociative attachment in plasma volume. However, hydrogen desorbed from metal hydride significantly changes the properties of the discharge. This is expressed, for example, in the fact that the plasma source based on Penning trap with metal hydride cathode appears to generate current-compensated ion beams with the ability to control the energy of the extracted ions. There is also the opportunity of longitudinal extraction of negative hydrogen ions against the traditional method of extraction across the magnetic field. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","The features of gas discharge and plasma sources based on Penning trap with metal hydride cathodes are presented.

!238,"Hydrogen storage is vital for use in fuel cells and nuclear thermal rockets (NTR), both of which benefit from low-energy reservoirs available for long durations. A novel method of solid-state storage using catalytically-modified porous silicon can be fabricated entirely from materials found on the Moon and in asteroids, requiring only a fixed quantity of reusable reagents to be brought from Earth. Consumables include silicon, aluminum, iron, and water, all of which can be extracted from suitable regolith ore bodies. An aluminum pressure vessel containing granular porous silicon particles is recharged by hydrogen pressures of 0.8 MPa. Once charged, the hydrogen storage subsystem can be maintained at any temperature from 0 to 373 K for an indefinite period, suitable for lunar nights or months-long trips to main-belt asteroids. Discharge is facilitated by heating above 393 K, provided by IR, resistive, or metal foam heat conductors embedded in the particulate bed. Systems-level volumetric and gravimetric storage metrics are 39 g/l and 5.8 percent w/w, respectively, comparable to cryogenic hydrogen storage in size and mass. The embodied energy in storing the hydrogen is very small, less than 2 percent of the embodied chemical energy, which makes it more efficient than cryogenic at 40 percent. Silicon and aluminum can be extracted from regolith using isotopic separation by charge/mass ratio. Iron and nickel are harvested from lunar regolith by electromagnets and used as the catalyst to mediate between gaseous hydrogen and monatomic surface adsorbed hydrogen. Deposition is accomplished via carbonyl gases, which require a quantity of CO, which is recovered after each use. Making the silicon porous requires hydrofluoric acid (HF), which will need to be supplied from Earth. The hydrofluorosilicic acid byproduct can be heated to decompose into HF vapor and silicon dioxide. The HF is condensed and re-used, and the silicon dioxide is a waste byproduct, which can be formed into quartz objects such as portals and glassware. A lunar factory with a mass of 7.5 MT can produce complete hydrogen storage vessels, assuming that electronic control can be provided by the remainder of the power system. With granular media, the size and shape of such vessels are essentially constrained. One example is two-meter thick shell sections for a deep space crew cabin for radiation protection.

It releases several unwanted gaseous products (e.g. NH3, B2H6) together with H2, and transforms into a residue that poses safety issues because of shock-sensitivity and reactivity towards O2/H2O.

The aim of the hydrogen storage technologies is thus to reduce the volume that hydrogen occupies in its thermodynamically stable state under conditions close to ambient salt. Recent work on hydrogen storage is mainly based on the use of metal hydrides. These metal hydrides have a high capacity for the hydrogen storage in the operating conditions. The effecting parameters on the performance of such a metal-hydrogen reactor are its design and configuration. In this case, there are a number of problems that need to be considered in designing a reactor.

Magnesium based materials are being studies for solid-state hydrogen storage due to their advantages of high volumetric and gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity. However, unfavorable thermodynamic and kinetic barriers hinder its practical application. In this work, we presented that kinetics of Mg-based composites were significantly improved during high energy ball milling in presence of various types of carbon, including plasma carbon produced by plasma-reforming of hydrocarbons, activated carbon, and carbon nanotubes. The improvement of the kinetics and de-/re-hydrogenation performance of MgH2 and TiC-catalysed MgH2 by introduction of carbon are strongly dependent on the milling time, amount of carbon and carbon structure. The lowest dehydrogenation temperature was observed at 180 °C by the plasma carbon–modified MgH2/TiC. We found that nanoconfinement of carbon structures stabilised Mg-based nanocomposites and hinders the nanoparticles growth and agglomeration. Plasma carbon was found to show better effects than the other two carbon structures because the plasma carbon contained both few layer graphene sheets that served as an active dispersion matrix and amorphous activated carbons that promoted the spill-over effect of TiC catalysed MgH2.

Analysis invoking the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami model and Kissinger plots show that the significantly reduced activation energy for the dehydrogenation process in the hybrid is responsible for the rapid kinetics.

Surface modification is achieved through engineering lanthanum (La)- or nickel (Ni)-rich surface layers with enhanced cyclic stability in an H2/O2 mixture. The formation of a Ni-rich surface layer does not improve the cycling stability in H2/O2 mixtures. Mischmetal (Mm, a mixture of La and Ce) agglomerates are observed within the bulk and surface of the alloy when small amounts of this material are added during arc melting synthesis. These agglomerates provide hydrogen-transparent diffusion pathways into the bulk of the V-Ti-Cr-Fe hydrogen storage alloy when the remaining oxidized surface is already nontransparent for hydrogen. Thus, the cycling stability of the alloy is improved in an O2-containing hydrogen environment as compared to the same alloy without addition of Mm.

However, during ex situ exchange reactions investigated by infrared (IR) and thermogravimetric (TG) analyses a comparable H → D exchange during long exposures (23 h) to deuterium atmosphere was observed for as received, ball milled and γ-Mg(BH4)2 + Nb2O5, while the Ni3B additive hindered isotopic exchange. The specific surface areas (SSA) were shown to be very different for as received γ-Mg(BH4)2, BET area = 900 m2 g-1, and ball milled Mg(BH4)2, BET area = 30 m2 g-1, respectively, and this explains why no gas-solid H(D) diffusion was observed for the ball milled (amorphous) Mg(BH4)2 during the short time frames of in situ Raman measurements. The heat treated ball milled sample partially regained the porous γ-Mg(BH4)2 structure (BET area = 560 m2 g-1).

!281,"Understanding diffusion of large solutes such as hydrogen and lithium in solids is of paramount importance for energy storage in metal hydrides and advanced batteries. Due to its high gravimetric and volumetric densities, magnesium is a material of great potential for solid-state hydrogen storage. However, the slow hydrogen diffusion kinetics and the deleterious blocking effect in magnesium have hampered its practical applications. Here, we demonstrate fast lateral hydrogen diffusion in quasifree magnesium films without the blocking effect. Massive concomitant lattice expansion leads to the formation of remarkable self-organized finger patterns extending over tens of micrometers. Detailed visualization of diffusion fronts reveals that the fingers in these patterns follow locally the direction of hydrogen diffusion. Thus, the streamlines of the diffusion process are self-recorded by means of the finger pattern. By inclusion of fast hydrogen diffusion objects or local gaps, the resulting streamlines exhibit a clear analogy to optical rays in geometric optics. The possibility to spatially manipulate hydrogen diffusion opens an avenue to build advanced hydrogen storage systems, cloaking and active plasmonic devices, as well as prototype systems for computational models. © 2018 American Physical Society.","Due to its high gravimetric and volumetric densities, magnesium is a material of great potential for solid-state hydrogen storage.

!291,"The hydrogen economy is a proposed system where hydrogen is produced and used extensively as the primary energy carrier. Successful development of hydrogen economy means innumerable advantages for the environment, energy security, economy, and final users. One major key to wholly develop hydrogen economy is safe, compact, light and cost-efficient hydrogen storage. The conventional gaseous state storage system as pressurized hydrogen gas and liquid state storage system pose safety and cost problems to onboard applications; therefore, they do not satisfy the future goals for a hydrogen economy. Fortunately, solid-state storage systems based on metal hydrides have demonstrated great potentials to store hydrogen in large quantities in a quite secure, compact, and repeatedly reversible manner and thus, becoming increasingly attractive option for hydrogen applications. However, techno-economic feasibility of hydrogen storage systems is yet to be realized as none of the current metal hydrides fulfill all the essential criteria for a practical hydrogen economy, mainly because of low hydrogen storage capacity, sluggish kinetics and unacceptable temperatures of hydrogen absorption/desorption. This article gives a brief review of hydrogen as an ideal sustainable energy carrier for the future economy, its storage as the stumbling block as well as the current position of solid-state hydrogen storage in metal hydrides and makes a recommendation based on the most promising novel discoveries made in the field in recent times which suggests a prospective breakthrough towards a hydrogen economy. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","The conventional gaseous state storage system as pressurized hydrogen gas and liquid state storage system pose safety and cost problems to onboard applications; therefore, they do not satisfy the future goals for a hydrogen economy.

The present study reveals that the phase transformation of LiAlH4 from the most stable form (α-phase) to the second most stable form (-phase) occurs at approximately 3.3 GPa, corresponding to a volume collapse of ∼14% and a reduction of 22% in the crystal volume. Due to the relatively higher hydrogen weight content, -LiAlH4 becomes a potentially attractive candidate for solid-state hydrogen storage at moderate pressures. The two most stable forms, i.e., the structures with the (i) P21/c (α-LiAlH4) and (ii) I41/a (-LiAlH4) space groups, have been selected so that their structural and electronic properties can be discussed in greater detail.

The microstructures of the as-cast and the milled alloys were characterized by means of X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) both prior and after the hydrogenation process. The storage characteristics (Pressure-Composition-Temperature isotherms) and the sorption kinetics obtained by a commercial and automatically controlled Sievert-type apparatus. The X-ray results showed that the substitution of Mn over Ni could eliminate and inhibit the MgNi2 phase. The calculation of the average crystallite size showed that the increase of the amount of Mn can reduce the size at the early stages, but for Mn content higher than 0.25 the crystallite size increases, while the microstrain levels decreased monotonically. The hydrogenation and dehydrogenation measurements took place at several temperatures (150–200–250–300 °C).

!296,"NaMgH3 has been considered to be a potential candidate for solid-state hydrogen storage due to its considerable hydrogen gravimetric (6.0 wt %) and volumetric (88.0 g/L) densities. Meanwhile, NaMgH3 possesses an outstanding theoretical thermal storage density of 2881 kJ/kg, which makes it one of the most promising thermal energy storage materials. However, the sluggish dehydrogenation kinetics of NaMgH3 embarrasses further practical application. Doping a nanosize Ti-based catalyst is treated to be one of the most effective methods to settle the poor dehydriding kinetics. In this work, different kinds of TiO2 catalysts, the 5 wt % TiO2 microparticle (MP) (100 nm), TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) (5-10 nm), and TiO2 nanotube (NT) (5-10 nm), were doped into NaMgH3 in the process of ball milling and heat treatment, which in situ formed Na0.46TiO2 significantly promoting the full hydrogen desorption kinetics of NaMgH3. Among all samples, the TiO2 NT-doped sample shows the best performance of which the onset decomposition temperature is reduced to 300 °C, and the first- and second-step decomposition peak temperatures are decreased to 346.3 and 355.8 °C, respectively. The TiO2 NT-doped sample desorbs approximately 3.4 wt % H2 at 350 °C within 10 min, while the pure NaMgH3 sample releases only 0.2 wt % H2 in 10 min. The significant improvement in both two decomposition reactions kinetics of NaMgH3 can be attributed to the tubular morphology of the TiO2 NT and the in situ formation of multivalence Ti species (Na0.46TiO2). These two reasons can change the kinetic models of NaMgH3 from A2 to R2 and further dramatically decrease the activation energies of first- and second-step decomposition reactions of NaMgH3 to 91.7 and 142.1 kJ/mol, respectively.

!298,"A holistic approach is required for the development of materials and systems for hydrogen storage, embracing all the different steps involved in a successful advance of the technology. The several engineering solutions presented in this work try to address the technical challenges in synthesis and application of solid-state hydrogen storage materials, mainly metal hydride based compounds. Moving from the synthesis of samples in lab-scale to the production of industrial sized batches a novel process development is required, including safety approaches (for hazardous powders), and methods to prevent the contamination of sensitive chemicals. The reduction of overall costs has to be addressed as well, considering new sources for raw materials and more cost-efficient catalysts. The properties of the material itself influence the performances of the hydride in a pilot storage tank, but the characteristics of the system itself are crucial to investigate the reaction limiting steps and overcome hindrances. For this, critical experiments using test tanks are needed, learning how to avoid issues as material segregation or temperature gradients, and optimizing the design in the aspects of geometry, hull material, and test station facilities.

!299,"Hydrogen energy is one of the most important choices for realizing clean energy because of its wide sources, no pollution, and high energy density. The technological innovation of fuel cells contributes to the attractive prospect of hydrogen energy in vehicles, but the problem of hydrogen filling and hydrogen storage has become one of the obstacles to the development of hydrogen energy cars. The safe and efficient hydrogen storage is crucial for the large-scale application of hydrogen energy. Till now there have been developed three main hydrogen storage methods, which include high-pressure gaseous hydrogen storage, low-temperature liquid hydrogen storage and solid-state hydrogen storage. The gravimetric density of gaseous hydrogen storage system can be promoted by increasing the pressure of hydrogen and the specific strength of container material. However, H2 molecular interaction causes a relatively low volumetric density of gaseous hydrogen storage system, and excessively high hydrogen pressure challenges the safety and heightens design difficulty and cost of hydrogen tanks. The liquid hydrogen storage owns ideal gravimetric and volumetric density, which can be realized by compres-sing and liquefying hydrogen gas. However, liquid hydrogen is particularly prone to volatilize and liquid hydrogen container requires strict storing conditions. In addition, the liquefying process of gaseous hydrogen is uneconomical, as it consumes an energy quantity that constitutes about 40% of the combustion heat release of the stored hydrogen. For the solid-state hydrogen storage, hydrogen is stored in the hydrides in the form of atom or ion. Hence, the solid-state hydrogen storage obtains an impressively high volumetric density and enjoys greater security because the hydrogen storage materials absorb/desorb hydrogen at mild conditions. But the gravimetric density of hydrogen storage materials is comparatively low. The high-pressure hybrid hydrogen storage vessel, which combines the advantages of gaseous and solid-state hydrogen storage methods, offers a feasible path to safe and high-density hydrogen storage. The volumetric density of high-pressure hydrogen tank can be effectively enhanced by the hydrogen storage materials, resulting in lower operating pressure, smaller volume, and higher safety. The performance promotion of the high-pressure hybrid hydrogen storage vessels depends upon the development of materials with excellent hydrogen sorption performances under high hydrogen pressure. The AB2 type ZrFe2-based and TiCr2 based alloys are the currently prevailing high-pressure hydrogen storage materials. Though researchers mainly concentrate on and have achieved the regulation of storage capacity, absorption/desorption pressure plateau and kinetics through the alloying trials which partially substitute elements with various atomic radius and electronic structures for either A-site or B-site, the gravimetric densities of ZrFe2-based and TiCr2-based alloys are still unsatisfactory. NaAlH4 and AlH3 display considerable potential as candidate storage materials owing to their intrinsically high storage density. For NaAlH4, sufficient works have preliminarily confirmed the effectiveness of nanosizing and catalyst-doping toward dehydrogenation temperature reduction and cyclic stability enhancement. And the yield of AlH3 along with its crystallinity can likely be enhanced by adopting ball milling or improving the solvent. This review starts with a brief introduction of how the high-pressure hybrid hydrogen storage vessel works and a summary of the performance requirements of the hydrogen storage materials. It then provides detailed discussion and description upon the structure, characteristics and research status quo with respect to the above-mentioned two species of high-pressure hydrogen storage materials, i.e.hydrogen storage alloys (ZrFe2, TiCr2) and aluminum based complex hydrides (NaAlH4, AlH3). © 2019, Materials Review Magazine.

!303,"Hydride nanocomposites in the (LiNH2 + nMgH2) system have been synthesized by ball milling with varying input of milling energy injected into powder particles, QTR (kJ/g). The grain (crystallite) size of LiNH2 and MgH2 decreases rapidly with increasing QTR up to approximately 150-200 kJ/g and subsequently more or less saturates at the value of 10-20 nm. For the injected energy QTR ≈ 250-350 kJ/g the specific surface area (SSA) increases from the initial 2.4 m2/g for powder mixtures before milling to 30-37 m2/g for nanocomposites after milling. After injecting QTR ≈ 550 kJ/g there is a further increase of SSA to 52 m2/g which is over 20-fold increase of SSA from its initial value. That clearly indicates that a profound reduction of particle size has occurred. The hydride phases formed during ball milling with relatively low QTR are identified as a-Mg(NH 2)2 (amorphous magnesium imide) and LiH. The ball milled (LiNH2 + nMgH2) nanocomposite system with n = 0.5-0.9 can effectively desorb about 4-5 wt.% H2 with a reasonable rate at the temperature range close to 200 °C. Within a low temperature range up to ∼250 °C, regardless of the molar ratio n and the injected energy Q TR the thermal desorption of the (LiNH2 + nMgH 2) nanocomposites occurs without any release of ammonia, NH 3. For all molar ratios, n, the hydride nanocomposites are fully reversible at 175 °C under a relatively mild pressure of 50 bar H 2. The quantity of H2 desorbed decreases with increasing molar ratio n, due to increasing fraction of inactive, retained MgH2. However, at 125 °C the dehydrogenation rate is very sluggish and the quantity of released H2 is minimal. At the temperature range lower than ∼250 °C dehydrogenation of ball milled nanocomposites occurs through formation of the Li2Mg(NH)2 hydride phase. The value of the measured dehydrogenation enthalpy change of 46.7 kJ/molH 2 is relatively low and apparently, it is not responsible for sluggish dehydrogenation at 125 °C. The measurements of thermal conductivity for non-milled powders and ball milled nanocomposites show a dramatic reduction of thermal conductivity after ball milling. It seems that this could be a principal factor responsible for such a low dehydrogenation rate at low temperatures. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

!304,"Owing to a theoretical hydrogen storage capacity of 10.5 wt% H2, Ca(BH4)2+MgH2, the so-called calcium reactive hydride composite (Ca-RHC), has a great potential as a hydrogen storage material.

By addition of 10 mol% of NbF5 into Ca(BH4)2+MgH2, a decrease of the dehydrogenation onset temperature by ∼120 K is observed. In order to understand the reasons behind this desorption temperature decrement two sets of samples [Ca(BH4)2+MgH2 and Ca(BH4)2+MgH2+0.1NbF5] in different hydrogenation states, were prepared. The structural investigation of the above mentioned sets of samples by means of volumetric measurements, anomalous small-angle X-ray scattering (ASAXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is reported here. The XAS results show that after the milling procedure NbB2 is formed and remains stable upon further de/rehydrogenation cycling.

Results from Ca ASAXS indicate Ca-containing nanostructures in the Ca-RHC+0.1NbF5 samples to be ∼50% finer compared to those without additive.

The structural parameters of α-MSiH3 and MSi including lattice constants and atomic positions are determined through geometry optimization.

The milling energy in a magneto-mill is estimated by a semi-empirical method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) measurements show that for the molar ratios n < 1.0 three new phases such as LiH, amorphous Mg(NH2)2 (a-Mg(NH2)2) and Li 2Mg(NH)2 are formed during ball milling depending on the injected quantity of milling energy. Hydrogen is not released during milling when the LiH and a-Mg(NH2)2 hydrides are being formed whereas the formation of the Li2Mg(NH)2 hydride phase is always accompanied by a profound release of hydrogen. For the molar ratios n ≥ 1.0, at a low level of injected milling energy, the hydride phases formed are LiH and a-Mg(NH2)2. The latter reacts with MgH 2 during further milling to form the new phase MgNH whose formation is also accompanied by a profound release of hydrogen.

!310,"In Part A of this manuscript which consists of two parts, the experimental investigations pertaining to the absorption of hydrogen in an LmNi 4.91Sn0.15 based solid state hydrogen storage device with embedded cooling tubes (ECT) are presented. Two metal hydride based hydrogen storage devices with 36 and 60 ECT filled with 2.75 kg of LmNi 4.91Sn0.15 were fabricated. Performances of the hydrogen storage devices in terms of hydrogen absorption rate and amount of hydrogen absorbed are reported for different supply pressures (10-35 bar), absorption temperatures (20-30 C) and cooling fluid flow rates (2.2-30 l/min). At any given absorption temperature, the rate of hydrogen absorption and the amount of hydrogen absorbed are found to increase with hydrogen supply pressure up to about 35 bar. At the supply condition of 35 bar hydrogen pressure and 30 C absorption temperature, with oil as a heat transfer fluid at a flow rate of 3.2 l/min, the maximum amount of hydrogen absorbed are ≈1.18 wt% in 10 min for 36 ECT, and 8 min for 60 ECT.

The hydrogen energy seems to be a promising candidate. To explore the possibility of achieving a solid-state high-capacity storage of hydrogen for onboard applications, we have performed first-principles density functional theoretical calculations of hydrogen storage properties of beryllium oxide clusters (BeO)n (n = 2-8). We observed that a polar BeO bond is responsible for H2 adsorption. The problem of cohesion of beryllium atoms does not arise, as they are an integral part of BeO clusters.

!318,"MgH2 is a promising material for reversible solid-state hydrogen storage. It is known that particle size can have a strong impact on hydrogen dynamics and sorption characteristics, but more detailed insight has been hampered by the great challenge to prepare small and well-defined particles and study their hydrogen storage properties upon cycling. The preparation of MgH2 nanoparticles supported on high surface area carbon aerogels with pore sizes varying from 6-20 nm is reported. Two distinctly different MgH2 particle populations are observed: X-ray diffraction invisible nanoparticles with sizes below 20 nm, and larger, crystalline, MgH2 particles. They release hydrogen at temperatures 140 °C lower than bulk MgH2. The size-dependent hydrogen kinetics is for the first time corroborated by intrinsic hydrogen dynamics data obtained by solid state 1H NMR. Fast cycling is possible (80% of the capacity absorbed within 15 min at 18 bar and 300 °C), without a change in the hydrogen sorption properties, showing that the growth of the nanoparticles is effectively prevented by the carbon support. A clear correlation is found between the hydrogen desorption temperature and the size of the MgH2 nanoparticles. This illustrates the potential of the use of supported nanoparticles for fast, reversible, and stable hydrogen cycling. Supported MgH2 nanoparticles on carbon with different sizes are synthesized and show faster hydrogen mobility and sorption kinetics.

!320,"Practical hydrogen storage for vehicular applications requires materials with high hydrogen densities, low decomposition temperature and fast adsorption and desorption kinetics. Till date, no reversible materials are currently known that posses all these attributes. Experimentally, testing the hydrogen storage capacity of a new material not only requires synthesis of a material but also the high precision equipments. The proposed material should also satisfy the target set by the US Department of Energy (DOE). If not, another material has to be synthesized. Theoretical H2 storage properties of a material can be evaluated precisely, and this may provide the mechanism to experimentalists for synthesizing such materials. Recent high performance computational techniques help us to predict the theoretical hydrogen uptake capacity of a material and provide information about its structure, stability and kinetics. Owing to their high uptake capacity at low temperature, structure stability, and excellent reversibility kinetics, organometallic nanostructures have attracted considerable attention as potential solid- state hydrogen storage materials. Here, the results from quantum chemical calculations on adsorption of dihydrogens on various organometallic complexes have been presented. Potential materials that were suited for storage of hydrogen in molecular form are particularly considered. The gravimetric H2 capacity of Scandium-decorated ethylene complex (14 wt%) is found to be well above the target specified by US DOE (5.5 wt% by 2015). Its cation adsorbs one additional molecule than the neutral thereby showing higher gravimetric H2 uptake by about 2 wt% than the neutral. Calculated averaged gain in energy of the complex favored for fast hydrogen adsorption and desorption kinetics. As found from many-body analysis technique, the H2 molecules interact strongly with the cation of C2H4:Sc than the neutral indicating an increase in metal bond strength. In case of Ti:C2H4 organometallic compound, it is found that the ionization process greatly improves its uptake capacity. The predicted gravimetric hydrogen uptake capacity of Ti:C2H4 (11.7 wt%) is in excellent agreement with the experimental value (12 wt%) reported earlier. Average Gibbs free energy correction was found to be as large as 0.45 eV and 0.44 eV for neutral and cation complexes, respectively. The Density Functional Theory (DFT) functionals as well as basis sets affect the averaged H2 adsorption energy with Gibbs free energy correction. The theoretical calculation of Equilibrium Isotope Effect (EIE) was also described. The vibrational frequencies of Ti:C2H4(nH2) and Ti:C2H4(nD2) for different 'n' are used to evaluate the EIE. The calculated EIE of 0.66 (for n=5) is also in excellent agreement with the experimental findings. Similar results were found in case of V:C2H4 complex. Hydrogen uptake capacity of V-capped and V-inserted V:C3H3 complexes was predicted and compared with other organometallic complexes containing single V atom decorated on different CnHn (n > 3) ring templates. The H2 uptake capacity of V:C3H3 organometallic compound is higher than other V-decorated CnHn (n > 3) ring templates reported earlier. The H2 adsorption on the V:C3H3 complex was found to be energetically favorable at finite temperature.

!322,"Nanostructured materials based on light elements such as Li, Mg, and Na are essential for energy storage and conversion applications, but often difficult to prepare with control over size and structure. We report a new strategy that is illustrated for the formation of magnesium boron hydrides, relevant compounds for instance for reversible solid state hydrogen storage. We started with small (5-10 nm) MgH2 nanoparticles inside the ∼10 nm pores of a carbon scaffold, and larger MgH2 crystallites on the exterior surface of the scaffold. The large difference in reactivity between the two types of MgH2 is used to selective react the small MgH2 particles inside the pores with B2H6 to form magnesium boron hydrides under mild conditions. In this way pore-confined magnesium boron hydrides are formed with MgB12H12 as the major phase. Hydrogen release from the confined magnesium boron hydrides starts just above the synthesis temperature of 120 °C. The addition of Ni brings about the reaction to proceed readily at temperatures as low as 30 °C. Furthermore, by Ni addition and tuning the synthesis temperature, the product distribution can be steered toward Mg(BH4)2 and other magnesium boron hydrides. This shows the suitability of our method to selectively form pore-confined complex metal hydrides, such as MgB12H12 for which no synthesis strategy had been reported until now.

!331,"Hydrogen diffusion impacts the performance of solid-state hydrogen storage materials and contributes to the embrittlement of structural materials under hydrogen-containing environments. In atomistic simulations, the diffusion energy barriers are usually calculated using molecular statics simulations where a nudged elastic band method is used to constrain a path connecting the two end points of an atomic jump. This approach requires prior knowledge of the ""end points"". For alloy and defective systems, the number of possible atomic jumps with respect to local atomic configurations is tremendous. Even when these jumps can be exhaustively studied, it is still unclear how they can be combined to give an overall diffusion behavior seen in experiments. Here we describe the use of molecular dynamics simulations to determine the overall diffusion energy barrier from the Arrhenius equation. This method does not require information about atomic jumps, and it has additional advantages, such as the ability to incorporate finite temperature effects and to determine the pre-exponential factor. As a test case for a generic method, we focus on hydrogen diffusion in bulk aluminum. We find that the challenge of this method is the statistical variation of the results. However, highly converged energy barriers can be achieved by an appropriate set of temperatures, output time intervals (for tracking hydrogen positions), and a long total simulation time. Our results help elucidate the inconsistencies of the experimental diffusion data published in the literature.

!337,"Energy is one of the basic requirements in our daily lives. Daily activities such as cooking, cleaning, working on the computer and commuting to work are more or less dependent on energy. The world's energy demand is continuously increasing over the years due to the ever-increasing growth in the human population as well as economic development. At present, approximately 90% of energy demands are fulfilled by fossil fuels. With the rising demands of energy throughout the globe, it can be expected that the availability of fossil fuels is depleting at an alarming rate since fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy. In addition, fossil fuels are the main contributor of greenhouse gas emissions and therefore, they have a detrimental impact on human health and environment in the long term. Hence, there is a critical need to develop alternative sources of energy in replacement of fossil fuels. Hydrogen fuels have gained much interest among researchers all over the world since they are clean, non-toxic and renewable, making them suitable for use as substitutes for petroleum-derived fuels in vehicular applications. However, the greatest challenge in using hydrogen fuels lies in the development of hydrogen storage systems, especially for on-board applications. Hydrogen fuels can be stored in gaseous, liquid or solid states, and much effort has been made to develop hydrogen storage systems that are safe, cost-effective, environmental-friendly and more importantly, with high energy densities. Current technologies used for hydrogen storage include high-pressure compression at about 70 MPa, liquefaction at cryogenic temperatures (20 K) and absorption into solid state compounds. Among the three types of hydrogen storage technologies, the storage of hydrogen in solid state compounds appears to be the most feasible solution since it is a safer and more convenient method compared to high-pressure compression and liquefaction technologies. In this regard, metal hydrides are potential chemical compounds for solid-state hydrogen storage, and a large number of studies have been carried out to synthesize low-cost metal hydrides with low absorption/desorption temperatures, high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen storage densities, good resistance to oxidation, good reversibility and cyclic ability, fast kinetics and reactivity, and moderate thermodynamic stability. In general, these studies have shown that the absorption/desorption properties of hydrogen can be improved by: (1) the addition of catalysts into the metal hydrides, (2) alloying the metal hydrides, or (3) nanostructuring.

A focus on the gravimetric and volumetric storage capacities for different examples from binary, ternary and complex hydrides is presented, with a comparison between thermodynamic prediction and experimental results. MgH2 constitutes one of the most attractive metal hydrides with a reversible capacity of 1480 mA·h·g-1 at a suitable potential (0.5 V vs Li+/Li0) and the lowest electrode polarization (<0.2 V) for conversion materials. Conversion process reaction mechanisms with lithium are subsequently detailed for MgH2, TiH2, complex hydrides Mg2MHx and other Mg-based hydrides. The reversible conversion reaction mechanism of MgH2, which is lithium-controlled, can be extended to others hydrides as: MHx + xLi+ + xe- in equilibrium with M + xLiH. Other reaction paths-involving solid solutions, metastable distorted phases, and phases with low hydrogen content-were recently reported for TiH2 and Mg2FeH6, Mg2CoH5 and Mg2NiH4. The importance of fundamental aspects to overcome technological difficulties is discussed with a focus on conversion reaction limitations in the case of MgH2. The influence of MgH2 particle size, mechanical grinding, hydrogen sorption cycles, grinding with carbon, reactive milling under hydrogen, and metal and catalyst addition to the MgH2/carbon composite on kinetics improvement and reversibility is presented. Drastic technological improvement in order to the enhance conversion process efficiencies is needed for practical applications. The main goals are minimizing the impact of electrode volume variation during lithium extraction and overcoming the poor electronic conductivity of LiH.

Products were characterized by IR, solution- and solid-state NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single-crystal or powder X-ray diffraction analysis. For hydrated salts, thermal decomposition proceeded in three stages, loss of water to form first hexahydrated then trihydrated, and finally loss of water and hydrogen to form polyhydroxylated complexes. For partially ammoniated salts, two stages of thermal decomposition were observed as ammonia and hydrogen were released with weight loss first of 14% and then 5.5%. Thermal decomposition of methanolated salts proceeded through a single step with a total weight loss of 32% with the release of methanol, methane, and hydrogen.

This paper reveals the effect of Na doping in accelerating initial hydrogen uptake in Mg–Ni alloys using in-situ Synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction. A minimum concentration of approximately 0.2 wt.% Na must be achieved for the alloys to show reasonably fast hydriding kinetics. Surface analysis shows that a Na-modified Mg–Ni surface facilitates the chemisorption and dissociation of hydrogen molecules in the early stage of hydriding as evidenced by a rapid formation of the saturated hydrogen solid solution Mg2NiH0.3 from the original Mg2Ni.

However, hydrogen release and especially uptake after desorption are sluggish and require high temperatures and pressures. Kinetics can be greatly enhanced by nanostructuring, for instance by confining metal hydrides in a porous carbon scaffold. We present for a detailed study of the impact of the nature of the carbon-metal hydride interface on the hydrogen storage properties. Nanostructures were prepared by melt infiltration of either NaAlH4 or LiBH4 into a carbon scaffold, of which the surface had been modified, varying from H-terminated to oxidized (up to 4.4 O/nm2). It has been suggested that the chemical and electronic properties of the carbon/metal hydride interface can have a large influence on hydrogen storage properties. However, no significant impact on the first H2 release temperatures was found. In contrast, the surface properties of the carbon played a major role in determining the reversible hydrogen storage capacity. Only a part of the oxygen-containing groups reacted with hydrides during melt infiltration, but further reaction during cycling led to significant losses, with reversible hydrogen storage capacity loss up to 40% for surface oxidized carbon. However, if the carbon surface had been hydrogen terminated, ∼6 wt% with respect to the NaAlH4 weight was released in the second cycle, corresponding to 95% reversibility.

The hydrogen storage capacity of metallic glassy hydrides (MGHs) is obviously higher than that of their crystalline counterparts owing to the free volume and disordered atomic structure associated with glasses. The glass-to-glass transition is demonstrated by direct experimental observation using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Remarkably, the dehydrogenation temperature of the MGHs can be efficiently tuned as it shows a close relationship with the enthalpy of mixing between the alloying element and hydrogen, and can be decreased from ∼350 °C to ∼150 °C when alloying with 5 at.%-Cu. MGs therefore have great potential as solid-state hydrogen storage materials. © 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.",The hydrogen storage capacity of metallic glassy hydrides (MGHs) is obviously higher than that of their crystalline counterparts owing to the free volume and disordered atomic structure associated with glasses.

!380,"The crystal structure of an aluminum-based borohydride ammoniate - Al(BH4)3·6NH3 - is reported for the first time. The molecular structure of Al(BH4)3· 6NH3 is resolved by high-resolution X-ray diffraction. The compound crystallized in the space group Pbcn (No. 60), with lattice parameters of a = 13.2824(5) Å, b = 15.2698(7) Å and c = 13.1848(6) Å. Structure analysis shows that this compound contains complex hexamminealuminum (III) [Al(NH3)6]3+ cations, which are surrounded by BH4- anions. The interatomic distances between the Hδ+s from the NH3 units and the Hδ-s from the BH4 units are in the range of 1.91-2.19 Å, suggesting the presence of significant Hδ+â|̄-δH interactions. Mass spectrometry, thermogravimetry and temperature-programmed desorption studies of metal cation-modified aluminum-based borohydride ammoniates using the reactions of various metal borohydrides M(BH4)n (M = Na, Li, Ca, Mg) and chlorides MCln (M = Sc, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mg, Ca, Li) reveal that their dehydrogenation properties are strongly dependent on the polarizing power of the added metal cations. It is hypothesized that the added metal cations may activate the borohydride ion to such an extent that its H δ- can easily react with the Hδ+ of the [Al(NH3)6]3+ cation, resulting in an enhanced interaction between the Hδ+ and Hδ-, thus enhancing their dehydrogenation kinetics. Subsequent deuterium isotope and X-ray measurements support the hypothesis that the Hδ+â|̄ -δH interactions play a role in the dehydrogenation of the metal borohydride ammoniates. Of the systems investigated, 0.5Mg(BH 4)2/Li2Al(BH4)5· 6NH3 is notable as it releases more than 10 wt.% high-purity H 2 within 30 min below 120 C.

!381,"The reaction of hydrogen with metals to form metal hydrides has numerous potential energy storage and management applications. The metal hydrogen system has a high volumetric energy density and is often reversible with a high cycle life. However, improving the often poor gravimetric performance of such systems through the use of lightweight metals usually comes at the cost of reduced reaction rates or the requirement of pressure and temperature conditions far from the desired operating conditions. Most studies of reaction kinetics of such systems focus on fitting low-dimensional kinetic models to measured rates and inferring the rate-limiting process based on the quality of the fit. This work develops a methodology for describing these reactions using a multi-process model of the physical transport and energy state transitions of interstitial hydrogen atoms within a metal lattice. In its nondimensional form, this model is applicable to arbitrary geometries and dimensions using four nondimensional kinetic parameters based on the physical transport mechanisms present in the system. The proposed model is then used for LaNi5 and TiCrMn to examine how the nucleation pattern, kinetic parameters, and particle aspect ratio affect the time of formation of a closed hydride layer and the apparent measured kinetics.

Reduction of dehydrogenation temperature and faster kinetics are obtained with increase of ACNFs content.

!390,"Beside commonly known applications of activated carbon in numerous fields, it has attracted considerable amount of research attention as a medium for solid-state hydrogen storage (also known as electrochemical hydrogen storage). Hydrogen in solid-state could be stored either by physical adsorption (or physisorption) or by forming chemical bonds (or chemisorption). Activated carbon offers large internal pore surface area and high porosity that favors both physisorption and chemisorption. Other advantages of using activated carbon for electrochemical hydrogen storage are different pore sizes - macropores, mesopores, micropores and ultramicropores, low atomic weight and easy availability. The present chapter reports on experimental investigation on different grades of activated carbons, made from coal, for their electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity. The fabrication process of activated carbon-based solid electrodes is explained. The steps involved in testing of the fabricated electrodes for their electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity are given.

In spite of drawbacks such as unfavorable thermodynamics and poor kinetics, enhancements may occur in reactive hydride composites by nanostructuring of reactant phases and formation of more stable product phases (e.g. MgB2) which lower overall reaction enthalpy and allow reversibility. One potential system is based on mixing NaBH4 and MgH2 and subsequent ball milling, which in a 2:1 molar ratio can store considerable amounts of hydrogen by weight (up to 7.8 wt%).

These temperatures are obtained by adding a dopant. TiCl3, ScCl3 or CeCl3 are known to be efficient dopants but the details of the catalytic mechanism are not fully understood yet. In this work, the H 2 sorption of NaAlH4 doped with TiCl3, ScCl3 or CeCl3 is systematically studied. The doped samples were prepared in one step by reactive ball milling of NaH and Al with 4 mol.% dopant in an H2 atmosphere. The efficiencies of the dopants are different for desorption and absorption, indicating that different catalytic mechanisms and rate limiting steps are taking place during both steps and these are described here. TiCl3 is more efficient for desorption and CeCl3 for absorption. ScCl3 is less efficient than the first two for all reactions. A mixture of TiCl3 and CeCl3 is thus added to NaAlH4 to act at the same time on the desorption and the absorption processes.

Current hydrogen storage options, such as compressed gas and liquid hydrogen, fall short of meeting vehicle manufacturers' goals for safe and efficient energy storage. The most viable long-term alternative to these options is solid-state storage, which has been proven both safe and efficient. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL), with over 50 years of hydrogen storage expertise and over 25 years of expertise in solid-state storage, is working with the Department of Energy's Hydrogen Storage Center of Excellence in Metal Hydrides to help solve this key challenge. A considerable amount of the Center's current efforts involve research to develop new high capacity hydrogen storage materials. However the overall objective of the Center is to deliver a 1 kg of hydrogen prototype vessel that meets the 2010 U.S. DOE FreedomCAR targets, which includes 6wt% hydrogen in the system. To meet this challenging target, will not only require the development of a new light weight hydrogen storage material but also, will require similar breakthroughs in vessel and system design, engineering and fabrication technology. SRNL is leading this systems engineering and analysis activity for the DOE Metal Hydride Center of Excellence. The SRNL team is comprised of distinguished scientists and engineers from national laboratories, leading universities, and major corporate research centers that have extensive experience in solid-state hydrogen storage systems as well as supporting expertise in heat transfer, systems modeling and component and systems development and manufacturing. To meet the FreedomCAR storage goals, engineering and system development tasks will need to be worked in parallel with material development. This approach will ensure that material development and engineering efforts are coordinated and focused on creating a suitable storage material and a compatible storage container. This approach considers the many required tradeoffs. For example, selection of a hydrogen storage material with a high equilibrium pressure could adversely affect the vessel's pressure design and, in turn, its weight, and perhaps the overall hydrogen charging time. Lower pressure materials would permit the use of lightweight storage containers and even possible conformable tank shapes. The Center's efforts will build on the experience and ongoing work of its lead and partners. The Center will also share its knowledge and expertise to solve emerging safety and engineering issues. The major engineering and system development tasks being carried out by the center include: • Heat transfer modeling and verification • Engineering materials property measurements i.e. kinetics, heat capacity, packing density, cycling performance etc. • Material production scale-up. • Safety issues including risk identification and mitigation. • Subsystem fabrication and testing • Prototype system fabrication and testing • System modeling and integration. • Manufacturability and cost estimates.

MOF-74(Mg) is stable under repeated hydrogen desorption and hydride regeneration cycles, allowing it to serve as a ""nanoreactor"". Confining NaAlH4 within these pores alters the decomposition pathway by eliminating the stable intermediate Na3AlH6 phase observed during bulk decomposition and proceeding directly to NaH, Al, and H2, in agreement with theory. The onset of hydrogen desorption for both Ti-doped and undoped nano-NaAlH4@MOF-74(Mg) is ∼50 °C, nearly 100 °C lower than bulk NaAlH4. However, the presence of titanium is not necessary for this increase in desorption kinetics but enables rehydriding to be almost fully reversible. Isothermal kinetic studies indicate that the activation energy for H2 desorption is reduced from 79.5 kJ mol-1 in bulk Ti-doped NaAlH4 to 57.4 kJ mol-1 for nanoconfined NaAlH4. The structural properties of nano-NaAlH 4@MOF-74(Mg) were probed using 23Na and 27Al solid-state MAS NMR, which indicates that the hydride is not decomposed during infiltration and that Al is present as tetrahedral AlH4 ® anions prior to desorption and as Al metal after desorption.

This approach insures a consistency between key model parameters and the observed liquid properties of the adsorbed phase at the lowest temperatures. We show that modeling using temperature-dependent saturation pressures and adsorbed phase densities leads to important differences in the projected usable storage capacities. Such differences can be as much as 25% at 50 K in the high pressure limit, revealing the importance of physical insights in the modeling approach. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",Exploring and evaluating on-board solid state hydrogen storage systems performance are of great interest for fuel cell electric vehicles development.

!429,"Proof-of-principle gas-reservoir MnNiMg electrochromic mirror devices have been investigated. In contrast to conventional electrochromic approaches, hydrogen is stored (at low concentration) in the gas volume between glass panes of the insulated glass units (IGUs). The elimination of a solid state ion storage layer simplifies the layer stack, enhances overall transmission, and reduces cost. The cyclic switching properties were demonstrated and system durability improved with the incorporation a thin Zr barrier layer between the MnNiMg layer and the Pd catalyst. Addition of 9% silver to the palladium catalyst further improved system durability. About 100 full cycles have been demonstrated before devices slow considerably. Degradation of device performance appears to be related to Pd catalyst mobility, rather than delamination or metal layer oxidation issues originally presumed likely to present significant challenges. © 2008.","In contrast to conventional electrochromic approaches, hydrogen is stored (at low concentration) in the gas volume between glass panes of the insulated glass units (IGUs).

!430,"Intermetallic compounds are able to store reversibly large amount of hydrogen. The hydride formation usually takes place through a two-phase domain for which an equilibrium plateau is observed between the metallic phase and its hydride. Such phase transformation induces important structural changes such as volume expansion (either isotropic and anisotropic), symmetry lowering, hydrogen ordering and phase transitions. In some cases, change of the electronic structure, from metallic to ionocovalent state, is reported. Finally, amorphization can occur leading to disproportionation of the parent compound. In this overview we give some examples of these different behaviors to illustrate the fascinating structural properties of these materials that are of potential interest from the fundamental point of view and for practical applications like energy storage either by solid-gas or electrochemical routes. © by Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, München.","Intermetallic compounds are able to store reversibly large amount of hydrogen.

!431,"Metal hydrides are likely candidates for the solid state storage of hydrogen. NaAlH4 is the only complex metal hydride identified so far that combines favorable thermodynamics with a reasonable hydrogen storage capacity (5.5 wt %) when decomposing in two steps to NaH, Al, and H2. The slow kinetics and poor reversibility of the hydrogen desorption can be combatted by the addition of a Ti-based catalyst. In an alternative approach we studied the influence of a reduced NaAlH4 particle size and the presence of a carbon support. We focused on NaAlH4/porous carbon nanocomposites prepared by melt infiltration. The NaAlH4 was confined in the mainly 2-3 nm pores of the carbon, resulting in a lack of long-range order in the NaAlH4 structure. The hydrogen release profile was modified by contact with the carbon; even for ∼10 nm NaAlH4 on a nonporous carbon material the decomposition of NaAlH4 to NaH, Al, and H2 now led to hydrogen release in a single step. This was a kinetic effect, with the temperature at which the hydrogen was released depending on the NaAlH4 feature size. However, confinement in a nanoporous carbon material was essential to not only achieve low H2 release temperatures, but also rehydrogenation at mild conditions (e.g., 24 bar H 2 at 150 °C). Not only had the kinetics of hydrogen sorption improved, but the thermodynamics had also changed. When hydrogenating at conditions at which Na3AlH6 would be expected to be the stable phase (e.g., 40 bar H2 at 160 °C), instead nanoconfined NaAlH4 was formed, indicating a shift of the NaAlH 4↔Na3AlH6 thermodynamic equilibrium in these nanocomposites compared to bulk materials. © 2010 American Chemical Society.","Metal hydrides are likely candidates for the solid state storage of hydrogen.

NaNH2BH3 is a promising solid-state hydrogen storage material, known to dehydrogenate in milder conditions than its parent compound. The preparation was made from sodium hydride NaH and NH3BH3 according to three different energy-efficient routes: namely, ball-milling, grinding in a mortar, and simple mixing with a spatula. In each case, NaNH2BH3 was formed. In other words, it has been demonstrated that the solid-solid reaction between NaH and NH3BH3 can take place by simple contact of these molecules, owing to the basic character of the former and the acidity of the latter. The as-formed materials dehydrogenate to a high extent at low temperature, with ca. 2 equivalent hydrogen H2 (NH3-free in our conditions) evolving at temperatures up to 95 °C. An effective gravimetric hydrogen density of ca. 7.4 wt% was calculated, which may correspond to an effective capacity of 3.7 wt% (assuming the weight of NaNH 2BH3 amounts to 50% of the weight of the whole storage system).

Borohydrides such as LiBH4 have been studied or proposed as candidates for hydrogen storage because of their high hydrogen contents (18.4 wt% for LiBH4). Limited success has been made in reducing the dehydrogenation temperature. However, full reversibility has not been realized. It is found that the dehydrogenation mechanism of metal borohydrides differs signicantly from the well-known metal hydrides such as LaNi5H 6 and MgH2 that release hydrogen in a single decomposition step through a solid state transformation of crystalline structure. The dehydrogenation of lithium borohydrides involves solid-liquid-gas reactions. Some of the steps in the multiple step decomposition processes of metal borohydrides are not reversible. Furthermore, the decomposition also produces stable intermediate compounds that cannot be rehydrided easily. Lastly, the volatile gases, such as BH3 and B2H6, evolved in decomposition of the transition metal borohydrides cause unrecoverable boron loss. Although our experiments show the partial reversibility of the doped LiBH4, it was not sustainable during dehydriding-rehydriding cycles because of the accumulation of hydrogen inert species and boron loss.

The effectiveness of this synthesis technique and the possible substitution of Cl ions in the borohydride phases is analysed depending on the back-pressure used for milling. When performed by ball milling under Ar, the metathesis reaction is not successful. A large quantity of a solid solution Li(BH4)1-xClx remains in the sample and CaHCl is formed rather than Ca(BH4)2.

Moreover, a further decrease of the dehydrogenation temperature has been observed by increasing the specific surface area of the support and the pores volume and by using the prepared mixtures instead of pure materials.

!458,"The major obstacle in transition to the hydrogen economy is the problem of onboard hydrogen storage. Solid-state hydrogen storage is the safest and most efficient method for hydrogen storage. Most of the metal hydrides exhibit very large volumetric storage density but less than 5 wt % gravimetric hydrogen density. Light metals such as Al, B bind with four hydrogen atoms and form together with an alkali metal an ionic or partially covalent compound called complex hydride. LiBH4 is a complex hydride with 18.5 mass % gravimetric hydrogen density and 121 kg/m3 volumetric hydrogen storage capacity. The desorption temperature of LiBH4 is greater than 470°C, thus making it difficult to use for storage applications. In addition, the conditions for reversible reaction are unfavorable. Modification of thermodynamics of the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reaction is possible by using additives which could destabilize LiBH4 by stabilizing the dehydrogenated state. This could decrease the heat of reaction and reduce the desorption temperature at the same time, making the conditions for reversible reaction more optimum.

Multi-component metal hydrides belong to one of the promising categories of materials that can potentially offer high hydrogen storage capacity. Despite extensive research on metal hydrides over the past decades, the progress remains limited partly due to the inability of screening a nearly infinite number of possible alloy compositions. High throughput materials fabrication and characterization techniques therefore offer an advantage in studying multi-component alloys and their phase transition to metal hydrides. We fabricated an Mg-Ni-Al and Ca-B-Ti ternary alloy libraries using a continuous combinatorial material synthesis technique, and measured the optical reflectance to examine the formation of metal hydride phase when the alloy library was exposed to hydrogen. The results indicate that mapping the change in reflectance is a viable method to study the kinetics of hydride formation.

Much effort has gone into understanding the rate-limiting processes in its hydrogen release and absorption reactions.

In this paper, we outline an approach for calculating the diffusivity of defects in complicated lattices using a combination of first-principles density-functional theory calculations and stochastic kinetic Monte Carlo methods. We apply this methodology to the diffusion of metal defects in NaAlH4 and Na3AlH 6 that have been predicted to exist in large concentrations.

!468,"The recent advances on the effects of microstructural refinement and various nano-catalytic additives on the hydrogen storage properties of metal and complex hydrides obtained in the last few years in the allied laboratories at the University of Waterloo (Canada) and Military University of Technology (Warsaw, Poland) are critically reviewed in this paper. The research results indicate that microstructural refinement (particle and grain size) induced by ball milling influences quite modestly the hydrogen storage properties of simple metal and complex metal hydrides. On the other hand, the addition of nanometric elemental metals acting as potent catalysts and/or metal halide catalytic precursors brings about profound improvements in the hydrogen absorption/desorption kinetics for simple metal and complex metal hydrides alike. In general, catalytic precursors react with the hydride matrix forming a metal salt and free nanometric or amorphous elemental metals/intermetallics which, in turn, act catalytically. However, these catalysts change only kinetic properties i.e. the hydrogen absorption/desorption rate but they do not change thermodynamics (e.g., enthalpy change of hydrogen sorption reactions). It is shown that a complex metal hydride, LiAlH4, after high energy ball milling with a nanometric Ni metal catalyst and/or MnCl2 catalytic precursor, is able to desorb relatively large quantities of hydrogen at RT, 40 and 80 °C.

Solid-state materials have shown potential advantages for hydrogen storage in comparison to other storage methods. In this article, the most popular solid-state storage materials and methods including carbon based materials, metal hydrides, metal organic frameworks, hollow glass microspheres, capillary arrays, clathrate hydrates, metal nitrides and imides, doped polymer and zeolites, are critically reviewed.

Most of the chemisorption-based materials are very expensive and in some cases, the hydrogen absorption/desorption phenomena isirreversible. Furthermore, a very high temperature is required to release the adsorbed hydrogen.

!478,"Hydrogen is expected to play an important role as an energy carrier in a future, more sustainable society. However, its compact, efficient, and safe storage is an unresolved issue. One of the main options is solid-state storage in hydrides. Unfortunately, no binary metal hydride satisfies all requirements regarding storage density and hydrogen release and uptake. Increasingly complex hydride systems are investigated, but high thermodynamic stabilities as well as slow kinetics and poor reversibility are important barriers for practical application. Nanostructuring by ball-milling is an established method to reduce crystallite sizes and increase reaction rates. Since five years attention has also turned to alternative preparation techniques that enable particle sizes below 10 nanometers and are often used in conjunction with porous supports or scaffolds. In this Review we discuss the large impact of nanosizing and -confinement on the hydrogen sorption properties of metal hydrides. We illustrate possible preparation strategies, provide insight into the reasons for changes in kinetics, reversibility and thermodynamics, and highlight important progress in this field. All in all we provide the reader with a clear view of how nanosizing and -confinement can beneficially affect the hydrogen sorption properties of the most prominent materials that are currently considered for solid-state hydrogen storage.

!484,"Magnesium is a promising material for solid state hydrogen storage, since it has low cost and its hydride can store reversibly up to 7.6 wt.% of hydrogen. Fast H-sorption kinetics at around 300 °C can be achieved after processing Mg-based mixtures by high energy ball milling (HEBM), which produces nanostructured composite powders. Severe plastic deformation (SPD) processing techniques are being explored as an alternative to HEBM in order to obtain more air-resistant materials and to reduce the time and energy required for processing. In this paper, MgH2 and MgH2-Fe mixtures were severely mechanically processed by extensive cold forging (CF) and cold rolling (CR). A very significant grain refinement (up to 10 nm) was achieved, which is comparable to the values typically obtained after processing by HEBM. Enhanced H-sorption properties were observed for these mechanically processed MgH 2-based nanocomposites in comparison with commercial magnesium hydride. The obtained compacts after CR and CF presents a much lower specific surface area than the ball-milled powders and therefore show higher air-resistance.

Important reaction steps take place at the very surface of the solid during hydrogen absorption. Since these reaction steps are drastically influenced by the properties and potential contamination of the solid, it is very important to understand the characteristics of the surface, and a variety of analytical methods are required to achieve this. In this work, a TiMn2-type metal hydride alloy is investigated by means of high-pressure activation measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), secondary neutral mass spectrometry (SNMS) and thermal desorption mass spectrometry (TDMS). In particular, TDMS is an analytical tool that, in contrast to SIMS or SNMS, allows the hydrogen content in a metal to be quantified. Furthermore, it allows the activation energy for desorption to be determined from TDMS profiles; the method used to achieve this is presented here in detail. In the results section, it is shown that the oxide layer formed during manufacture and long-term storage prevents any hydrogen from being absorbed, and so an activation process is required.

!491,"LiAlH 4 containing 5 wt.% of nanometric Fe (n-Fe) shows a profound mechanical dehydrogenation by continuously desorbing hydrogen (H 2) during high energy ball milling reaching ∼3.5 wt.% H 2 after 5 h of milling. In contrast, no H 2 desorption is observed during low energy milling of LiAlH 4 containing n-Fe. Similarly, no H 2 desorption occurs during high energy ball milling for LiAlH 4 containing micrometric Fe (μ-Fe) and, for comparison, both the micrometric and nanometric Ni (μ-Ni and n-Ni) additive. X-ray diffraction studies show that ball milling results in a varying degree of the lattice expansion of LiAlH 4 for both the Fe and Ni additives. A volumetric lattice expansion larger than 1% results in the profound destabilization of LiAlH 4 accompanied by continuous H 2 desorption during milling according to reaction: LiAlH 4 (solid) → 1/3Li 3AlH 6 + 2/3Al + H 2. It is hypothesized that the Fe ions are able to dissolve in the lattice of LiAlH 4 by the action of mechanical energy, replacing the Al ions and forming a substitutional solid solution. The quantity of dissolved metal ions depends primarily on the total energy of milling per unit mass of powder generated within a prescribed milling time, the type of additive ion e.g. Fe vs. Ni and on the particle size (micrometric vs. nanometric) of metal additive. For thermal dehydrogenation the average apparent activation energy of Stage I (LiAlH 4 (solid) → 1/3Li 3AlH 6 + 2/3Al + H 2) is reduced from the range 76 to 96 kJ/mol for the μ-Fe additive to about 60 kJ/mol for the n-Fe additive. For Stage II dehydrogenation (1/3Li 3AlH 6 → LiH+1/3Al + 0.5H 2) the average apparent activation energy is within the range 77-93 kJ/mol, regardless of the particle size of the Fe additive (μ-Fe vs. n-Fe).

!492,"NaBH 4 is considered as a promising candidate material for solid-state hydrogen storage due to its high hydrogen content of 10.6 wt %.

In the present work, the effects of Ti-based additives, including Ti, TiH 2, and TiF 3, on the dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation of NaBH 4 (NaH+B) were investigated. It was revealed that all of the titanium-based additives were effective in improving the hydrogen desorption and absorption reactions of NaBH 4, and, among them, TiF 3 possessed the highest catalytic activity. The whole dehydrogenation process for the NaBH 4-0.05TiF 3 sample can be regarded as a two-step process: (i) a preferential reaction (3NaBH 4 + TiF 3 → 3NaF + TiB 2 + B + 6H 2) occurring at around 300 °C, and (ii) the formation of Ti- and F-containing species catalyze the dehydrogenation of the remaining NaBH 4. It was also indicated that the F anion can substitute for anionic H in NaH to form NaF 1-xH x in the case of NaH-B-0.05TiF 3 during the hydrogenation process.

!495,"A comprehensive study of the decomposition behavior of as received and mechanically (ball) milled LiAlH4 has been carried out using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and volumetric hydrogen desorption in a Sieverts-type apparatus. Alfa Aesar LiAlH4 powder investigated in this work has the average particle size of 9.9 ± 5.2 μm as compared to 50-150 μm for Sigma-Aldrich LiAlH4 investigated by Ares et al. [9]. High energy ball milling reduced the particle size of the present LiAlH4 to 2.8 ± 2.3 μm. In general, comparing the results of our microstructural studies with those reported by Ares et al. [9] it is clear that the morphology, microstructure and chemistry of LiAlH4 can be very dissimilar depending on the supplier from which LiAlH4 powder was purchased. We do not observe a partial decomposition of LiAlH4 during milling up to 5 h under high energy impact mode. The observed melting of LiAlH4 in a DSC test is a very volatile event where the liquid LiAlH4 starts foaming and flowing out of the alumina crucible. After completion of solidification and desorption at temperatures above melting the powder resembles a lava rock. A thermal sectioning in DSC tests at pre-determined temperatures and subsequent XRD studies show that LiAlH4 starts decomposing into Li 3AlH6 immediately after melting. Li3AlH 6 seems to be already solidified before it starts decomposing in the next stage. All volumetric desorption curves at the 120-300 °C range clearly exhibit a two-stage desorption process, Stage I and II. As received LiAlH 4 is able, in a fully solid state, to desorb at 120 °C under pressure of 0.1 MPa H2 (atmospheric) as much as 7.1 wt.%H2 within ∼259,000 s (∼72 h), i.e. ∼93% of the purity-corrected H 2 content from the reactions in Stage I (LiAlH4(s) → (1/3)Li3AlH6(s) + (2/3)Al(s) + H2) and Stage II ((1/3)Li3AlH6(s) → LiH + (1/3)Al + 0.5H 2). The apparent activation energy for Stage I and II for unmilled LiAlH4 is equal to ∼111 and ∼100 kJ/mol, respectively. For the ball milled LiAlH4 the apparent activation energy for Stage I and II is slightly lower ∼92.5 and ∼92 kJ/mol, respectively. The water absorption up to 11.7% due to exposure to air for 1 h does not change in any drastic way the hydrogen desorption rate of ball milled LiAlH4 in Stage I.

The conductivity is purely ionic, as electronic conductivities were measured to only 1.4 ×10 -8 and 9 ×10 -8 S•cm -1 at T = 20 °C for LiLa(BH 4) 3Cl and LiGd(BH 4) 3Cl, respectively.

!497,"The rapidly depleting petroleum feed stocks and increasing green house gas emissions around the world has necessitated a search for alternative renewable energy sources. Hydrogen with molecular weight of 2.016 g/mol and high chemical energy per mass equal to 142 MJ/kg has clearly emerged as an alternative to hydrocarbon fuels. Means for safe and cost effective storage are needed for widespread usage of hydrogen as a fuel. Chemical storage is the one of the safer ways to store hydrogen compared to compressed and liquefied hydrogen. It involves storing hydrogen in chemical bonds in molecules and materials where an on-board reaction is used to release hydrogen. Ammonia-borane, (AB, H 3N·BH3) with a potential capacity of 19.6 wt% is considered a very promising solid state hydrogen storage material. It is thermally stable at ambient temperatures. There are two major routes for the generation of H2 from AB: catalytic hydrolysis/alcoholysis and catalytic thermal decomposition. There has been a flurry of research activity on the generation of H2 from AB recently. The present review deals with an overview of our efforts in developing cost-effective nanocatalysts for hydrogen generation from ammonia borane in protic solvents.",The rapidly depleting petroleum feed stocks and increasing green house gas emissions around the world has necessitated a search for alternative renewable energy sources.

!498,"This paper discusses the results of an experimental program carried out to determine dust cloud deflagration parameters of selected solid-state hydrogen storage materials, including complex metal hydrides (sodium alanate and lithium borohydride/magnesium hydride mixture), chemical hydrides (alane and ammonia borane) and activated carbon (Maxsorb, AX-21). The measured parameters include maximum deflagration pressure rise, maximum rate of pressure rise, minimum ignition temperature, minimum ignition energy and minimum explosible concentration. The calculated explosion indexes include volume-normalized maximum rate of pressure rise (KSt), explosion severity (ES) and ignition sensitivity (IS). The deflagration parameters of Pittsburgh seam coal dust and Lycopodium spores (reference materials) are also measured. The results show that activated carbon is the safest hydrogen storage media among the examined materials. Ammonia borane is unsafe to use because of the high explosibility of its dust. The core insights of this contribution are useful for quantifying the risks associated with use of these materials for on-board systems in light-duty fuel cell-powered vehicles and for supporting the development of hydrogen safety codes and standards. These insights are also critical for designing adequate safety features such as explosion relief venting and isolation devices and for supplementing missing data in materials safety data sheets. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",The deflagration parameters of Pittsburgh seam coal dust and Lycopodium spores (reference materials) are also measured.

Aggregates were prepared by spontaneous aggregation of water soluble anionic porphyrins meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl) porphine (TCPP) and meso-tetra(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphine (TPPS) with cationic meso-tetra-p-trimethylaminophenyl porphine tetrachloride (TAP). Aggregate formation in solution was investigated via UV-visible spectroscopy at different pH ranges. At neutral to basic conditions, porphyrin pairs formed partially soluble hetero H-aggregates and at low pH, soluble homo J-aggregates was formed. H-aggregates were isolated by centrifuging and freeze-drying. The obtained solids were studied by X-ray powder diffraction. Thermal stability of dry aggregates was determined by thermogravimetric analysis. The TCPP-TAP hetero aggregates exhibited hydrogen uptake between 80 °C and 250 °C. The amount of hydrogen absorbed by the sample corresponds to 0.29% by weight, indicating a potential use of such materials as a solid state hydrogen storage medium.

After doping with TiCl3, Ti is present as an hcp-Ti(Al) solid solution, while for the Ti(OBu)4 doped system, Ti exists as an XRD-amorphous phase. Cycling of hydrogen for 1.5 times results in transformation of these initially different Ti compounds into similar compounds, whose composition is dependent on the temperature. Thus, if low temperatures were used during the cycling process (up to 175 °C) an amorphous Al-Ti alloy formed, while upon using high temperatures (200 °C and higher) Ti was present as an AlxTi intermetallic.

!503,"The reaction of gaseous hydrogen with hydride-forming metals and alloys often involves a hydride layer formed on the metallic surface. Under proper steady state conditions, this layer is moving into the bulk metal, retaining constant thickness and velocity. In this work, the kinetics of the moving hydride layer is analyzed, using a model combining the four main sequential steps: adsorption (chemisorption), penetration, diffusion and reaction, in which the hydrogen is transferred from the gas phase into the reaction site. The model yields the rate of absorption during the steady state hydriding process (proportional to the hydride layer velocity) as a function of the pressure, the rate constants of the system (adsorption, desorption, penetration, decomposition, diffusion and interface emission) and the critical concentrations of hydrogen in the hydride, Cmax, Cp and Cmin (the last is associated with the equilibrium absorption pressure Peq). According to the model, for sufficiently high pressures, the rate is pressure-independent. A simple expression for the pressure independent rate is derived. The conditions leading to rates limited by one of the four sequential steps are analyzed and demonstrated. Relatively simple expressions are derived for the rate's pressure dependence. It is shown that for the interface and diffusion controlled cases the general pressure dependence is of the form: Rate-1∝[(P/Peq)1/2-1]-1. For the adsorption controlled case the pressure dependence is Rate∝(P-Peq). Based on the model, a numerical procedure is proposed for a system, removed from an initial steady state, describing the time-dependent approach to the new steady state determined by the applied change. The model is successfully tested for a real case, the uranium-hydrogen system, which is shown to obey the interface control rate equations.","Under proper steady state conditions, this layer is moving into the bulk metal, retaining constant thickness and velocity.

!504,"A hydrogen engine-fuel system is being developed as an alternative for powering underground mining machinery. A diesel was converted to a spark-ignited hydrogen engine and operated with a metal hydride, solid-state hydrogen storage system. Performance and emissions data show that hydrogen can be used as an ultralow emission fuel for underground mining. A special method of fuel control has overcome abnormal combustion problems frequently experienced with hydrogen fuel. The turbocharged, after-cooled engine maintains NOX emissions (the only significant pollutant) below 0.7 gram per kilowatt-hour. Power and fuel consumption are comparable to the naturally aspirated, prechambered diesel version of the engine. Hydrogen fuel is released from a metal hydride storage container by heat from the engine coolant.

!505,"The effect of sequential and continuous high-energy impact mode in the magneto-mill Uni-Ball-Mill 5 on the mechano-chemical synthesis of nanostructured ternary complex hydride Mg2FeH6 was studied by controlled reactive mechanical alloying (CRMA). In the sequential mode the milling vial was periodically opened under a protective gas and samples of the milled powder were extracted for microstructural examination whereas during continuous CRMA the vial was never opened up to 270 h duration. MgO was detected by XRD in sequentially milled powders while no MgO was detected in the continuously milled powder. The abundance of the nanostructured ternary complex hydride Mg 2FeH6, produced during sequential milling, and estimated from DSC reached ∼44 wt.% after 188 h, and afterwards it slightly decreased to ∼42 wt.% after 210 and 270 h. In contrast, the DSC yield of Mg 2FeH6 after continuous CRMA for 270 h was ∼57 wt.%. Much higher yield after continuous milling is attributed to the absence of MgO. This behavior provides strong evidence that MgO is a primary factor suppressing formation of Mg2FeH6. The DSC hydrogen desorption onset temperatures are close to 200 °C while the desorption peak temperatures for all powders are below 300 °C and the desorption process is completed within the range 10-20 min. Within the investigated nanograin size range of ∼5-13 nm, the DSC desorption onset and peak temperatures of β-MgH2 and Mg2FeH6 do not exhibit any trend with nanograin (crystallite) size of hydrides. TPD hydrogen desorption peaks from the powders containing a single ternary complex hydride Mg2FeH6, are very narrow, which indicates the presence of small but well-crystallized hydride particles. Their narrowness provides good evidence that the phase composition, bulk hydrogen distribution and hydride particle size distribution are very homogeneous. The overall amount of hydrogen desorbed in TPD from single-hydride Mg2FeH6 powders is somewhat higher than that observed in DSC and TGA desorption. The powder milled sequentially for 270 h and desorbed in a Sieverts-type apparatus at 250 and 290 °C, yielded about a half of the hydrogen content obtained during DSC and TGA tests. No desorption of hydrogen was detected in a Sieverts-type apparatus at 250 and 290 °C after 128 and 70 min, respectively, from the powder continuously milled for 270 h.

!509,"The H2Fuel Bus is the world's first hydrogen-fueled electric hybrid transit bus (see Figure1.). It was a project developed through a public/private partnership involving several leading technological and industrial organizations, with primary funding by the Department of Energy (DOE). The primary goals of the project were to gain valuable information on the technical readiness and economic viability of hydrogen fueled buses and to enhance the public awareness and acceptance of emerging hydrogen technologies. The bus completed its field-testing and was placed into public service on September 4, 1998 by Augusta Public Transit in Augusta, Georgia. The bus employs a hybrid Internal Combustion (IC) engine/generator and battery powered electric drive system, with onboard storage of hydrogen in metal hydride beds. The initial operating results demonstrated an overall energy efficiency (miles/BTU) twice the range of a similar diesel-fueled bus, while doubling the range of an all-electric vehicle by providing in-transit recharging of the batteries. Subsequent data showed that the power controller was not optimized for maximum battery life and, therefore, some efficiency was lost. Correction of that condition would provide a daily range of at least 120 miles in a hybrid hydrogen/electric-operating mode.

Only traces of other, as yet unidentified phases are observed, one of which has been tentatively assigned to an Al-Ti alloy on the basis of XRD analysis.

Hydrogen represents an important option also to store energy in a long term scenario of fluctuating power generation from renewables sources (solar and wind). However, independently from the primary energy sources used for its production in medium and long term (fossil fuel with carbon dioxide sequestration, nuclear, renewables), R&D efforts must be focused henceforward on hydrogen related technologies, like fuel cells and advanced storage systems. Fuel cells, in particular, represent the ideal system to convert the hydrogen chemical energy into electricity with high efficiencies. The CESI experience on a grid connected PEFC system fuelled with hydrogen stored in metal hydrides is outlined in this presentation with emphasis on all the aspects related to subsystem interlacing. A 6,5 Nm3 capacity hydrogen storage was developed at CESI starting from commercial metal hydride powders supplied by LabTech Ltd. The heat transfer during the charge - discharge cycles and the useful hydrogen output were optimised in view of the coupling with a PEFC stack/module operating near ambient pressure. Three Independence 1000 PEFC modules were supplied by ReliOn and carefully characterised at CESI laboratories. This module is a rather open system and a lot of parameters can be acquired at operating conditions including all the cell and cartridges voltages, currents and temperatures. The module responses to an external electric load were investigated both in steady state conditions, by increasing gradually the load, and during steep load changes. The actual hydrogen consumption was measured at different operating conditions and LHV and HHV efficiencies were obtained as a function of the power output. The PEFC modules were connected to the local grid through a 3.3 kW DC-AC converter (inverter) that was supplied by SGS Future based on CESI specifications. The inverter efficiency exceeded 90%. A control system was set up in a LabVIEW™ environment to manage the hydrogen storage charge and discharge cycles and to test the PEFC - inverter system behaviour on different load profiles.

!514,"Although recently there have been many reports on the in-situ structural characterization of hydrogen storage alloys, these studies were all conducted under equilibrium states. In practice, however, hydrogen storage alloys alternate hydrogen absorption and desorption processes ceaselessly. Therefore, in functional situations where hydrogen storage alloys are utilized, their hydrogen absorption properties cannot be evaluated precisely by applying the results of observations made under equilibrium states. We assessed the hydrogen absorption behavior and phase transformation of LaNi 5 during the hydrogen absorption process using our newly developed time-resolved in-situ XRD system for vapor-solid phase reaction. This system, which comprises a chamber for performing in-situ XRD measurements, a Sieverts' component for measuring hydrogenation speed, and a PSPC (position-sensitive proportional counter) X-ray detector, enables sequential XRD measurement in an in-situ atmosphere. Over a period of several minutes, we observed the phase transformation of the master alloy of LaNi 5 into a hydride of LaNi 5H 6 during the hydrogen absorption process and evaluated the process sequentially at intervals of a few seconds. Our results showed that the actual phase transformation during the process of hydrogen storage differs from what had been characterized previously under an equilibrium state.
