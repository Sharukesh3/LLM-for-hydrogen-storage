Among the solid-state hydrogen storage materials, magnesium-based material exhibits many advantages and is considered one of the most promising materials. However, the disadvantages including poor hydrogen absorption, desorption kinetics and high operating temperature still need to be modified. The addition of catalysts is one of the optimal ways to improve the kinetic performance of MgH2. However, transition metal-based catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance. This work mainly summarizes the addition of Co/Ni/Fe-based catalysts on the hydrogen storage performances of Mg. While examining the differences in the performance of each catalyst, some future research perspectives are also illustrated. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","Catalysts; Desorption; Magnesium compounds; Transition metals; Absorption and desorptions; Catalyst addition; Effect of CO; Fe-based; Recent progress; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Storage medium; Storage technology; Technology absorption; ]+ catalyst; Hydrogen storage"

Owing to the lightweight, high hydrogen storage density and abundant reserves, MgH2 has been widely studied as one of the most promising solid-state hydrogen storage materials. However, defects such as stable thermodynamics, sluggish kinetics and rapid capacity decay have seriously hindered its practical application. This article reviews recent advances in catalyst doping and nanostructures for improved kinetic performance of MgH2/Mg systems for hydrogen release/absorption, the tuning of their thermodynamic stability properties by alloying and reactant destabilization, and the dual thermodynamic and kinetic optimization of the MgH2/Mg system achieved by nanoconfinement with in situ catalysis and ball milling with in situ aerosol spraying, aiming to open new perspectives for the scale-up of MgH2 for hydrogen storage applications.

However, the slow kinetics and poor cycle stability limit its application. In this work, LiBH4 and YNi5 alloy were co-added as additives to MgH2 via ball milling, thereby realizing an excellent dehydrogenation performance and good cycle stability at 300 °C. The MgH2-0.04LiBH4-0.01YNi5 composite can release 7 wt.% of hydrogen in around 10 min at 300 °C and still have a reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 6.42 wt.% after 110 cycles, with a capacity retention rate as high as 90.3 % based on the second dehydrogenation capacity. The FTIR results show that LiBH4 can reversibly absorb and desorb hydrogen throughout the hydrogen ab/desorption process, which contributes a portion of the reversible hydrogen storage capacity to the MgH2-0.04LiBH4-0.01YNi5 composite. Due to the small amount of LiBH4 and YNi5, the dehydrogenation activation energy of MgH2 did not decrease significantly, nor did the dehydrogenation enthalpy (∆H) change. However, the MgNi3B2 and in-situ formed YH3 during the hydrogen absorption/desorption cycles is not only beneficial to the improvement of the kinetics performance for MgH2 but also improves its cycle stability. This work provides a straightforward method for developing high reversible hydrogen capacity on Mg-based hydrogen storage materials with moderate kinetic performance. © 2023","High reversible capacity; Hydrogen storage; Lithium borohydride; Magnesium hydride; YNi<sub>5</sub> alloy","Activation energy; Additives; Ball milling; Dehydrogenation; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogen storage alloys; Kinetics; Lithium compounds; Magnesium compounds; Coaddition; Cycle stability; High reversible capacities; Hydrogen storage capacities; Hydrogen storage materials; Hydrogen-storage properties; Kinetics performance; Lithium borohydride; Solid-state hydrogen storage; YNi5 alloy; Binary alloys"

Further improvement of its kinetics and thermodynamic performances is needed to achieve widespread application. This article investigated the hydrogen storage properties of the thermodynamic optimized Mg-TiCrV hydrogen storage composite modified by layered Ti3C2 materials containing different 3d transition metal particles (Fe, Co, Ni). Mg-TiCrV/Ti3C2-X (X = Fe, Co, Ni) composites can absorb more than 5.30 wt% hydrogen within 1 min at 453 K under 3 MPa hydrogen pressure, and desorb more than 5.25 wt% hydrogen within 60 min at 543 K to 0.1 MPa. In particular, Mg-TiCrV/Ti3C2-Ni composite exhibited the best hydrogen storage properties, which can desorb 4.98 wt% hydrogen within 60 min at 523 K to 0.1 MPa hydrogen pressure and absorb 5.80 wt% hydrogen within 1 min at 453 K under 3 MPa hydrogen pressure.

Herein, a novel hydrangea-like NiO@NiMoO4 composite catalyst was prepared through a facile hydrothermal reaction. Subsequently, NiO@NiMoO4 was doped into MgH2 by ball milling to solve the problems of high dehydrogenation temperature and slow desorption kinetics of MgH2. It can be seen from the experimental results that the MgH2 + 10 wt% NiO@NiMoO4 composite starts to dehydrogenate at about 190 °C, which is about 170 °C lower than that of pure MgH2. Meanwhile, after complete dehydrogenation, the composites can start to absorb hydrogen below 40 °C. Compared with pure MgH2, the activation energy of hydrogen absorption and dehydrogenation of the composite decreased by 47.6 kJ/mol and 46.5 kJ/mol, respectively. In 10th cycle tests, the MgH2 + 10 wt% NiO@NiMoO4 composite still has good cycle stability. After adding a small amount of biomass charcoal, the hydrogen storage capacity can even be maintained above 97%. Furthermore, the characterization results show that the in situ generated new species Mo and Mg2Ni/Mg2NiH4 synergistically promote the adsorption and dissociation of hydrogen.

However, its main hydrogen release steps still require higher temperatures. In the present study, few-layer Ti2C has been synthesized and utilized as catalysts in the LMBH. Compositing LMBH with varying amounts of Ti2C (10, 20, 30, and 40 wt%) results in low initial dehydrogenation temperatures (164–110 °C), fast desorption rates and high hydrogen capacities (7.5–10.5 wt%) at a low temperature of 260 °C. The LMBH-30Ti2C composite yields 6.5 wt% H2 even at as low as 200 °C. Additionally, the LMBH-30Ti2C composite could reversibly store 3.5 wt% H2 during the second to fourth dehydrogenation cycles without degradation. The outstanding hydrogen storage performance could be attributed to decomposition driven by reactions between high-valence Ti ions and LMBH, the in-situ formation of the active metal Ti catalyst, and the prevention of aggregation in the Ti2C-doped LMBH. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Borohydride; Hydrogen storage; LiBH<sub>4</sub>; Mg(BH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>; MXene","Catalysts; Hydrogen storage; Lithium compounds; Magnesium compounds; Temperature; Titanium; Titanium compounds; Borohydrides; Eutectic composites; Highest temperature; Hydrogen capacities; Hydrogen release; Lows-temperatures; Mxene; Performance; Solid-state hydrogen storage; ]+ catalyst; Dehydrogenation"

However, high temperature of desorption (>350 °C) and slow kinetics limit its use for commercial on-board applications. In this work, accumulative roll bonding (ARB) technique has been utilized to synthesise Mg–LaNi5–Mg2Ni-soot hybrid with enhanced hydrogen storage properties. It is seen that the hybrid absorbs ∼6.2 wt% hydrogen at a plateau pressure of ∼2 bar at 300 °C and exhibits fast kinetics with ∼6.6 wt% hydrogen absorption within ∼30 min at 300 °C and 20 bar hydrogen pressure. The role of Mg2Ni as a catalyst as well as hydrogen absorbing medium provides an effect akin to ‘hydrogen pump’, thus enhancing the rate of hydrogen absorption. Presence of carbon in various forms such as aciniform, carbonaceous microgel and cenospheres (derived from soot) plays a vital role by providing channels for diffusion of hydrogen through the hybrid.

After compositing with MgH2, its initial hydrogen absorption started at a low temperature of 40 °C. At a temperature of 300 °C, 6.5 wt% of H2 was released in only 10 min. Furthermore, the kinetic analysis revealed a pivotal transformation in the control model for dehydrogenation of MgH2, shifted from surface penetration to diffusion at a moderate temperature of 250 °C with the introduction of CoNi-CoO@rGO. After modification, the activation energy for hydrogen de/absorption decreased from 116 kJ/mol and 79.39 kJ/mol, to 66 kJ/mol and 54.39 kJ/mol, respectively. It is noteworthy that the CoNi-CoO@rGO-modified MgH2 exhibited excellent cycling performance, retained an impressive hydrogen storage capacity of 97% after 20 cycles at 300 °C. The innovation of this work lies in the following three aspects: 1) the uniform distribution of CoNi-CoO@rGO nanoparticles on the surface of MgH2 significantly enhanced the contact area and promoted the catalytic activity, 2) the synergistic effect between Mg2Co-Mg2CoH5 and Mg2Ni-Mg2NiH4 attenuate the intensity of the Mg-H bond and quickened the post-discharge of MgH2, 3) the incorporation of a CoO-induced Schottky structure accelerated the H transfer in MgH2 and improved the hydrogen absorption and release efficiency. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Catalysis; MgH<sub>2</sub>; Schottky-structured CoNi nano-alloys; Solid-state hydrogen storage","Activation energy; Catalyst activity; Cobalt alloys; Cobalt compounds; Hydrogen storage; Magnesium compounds; Temperature; Compositing; Control model; Hydrogen absorption; Kinetic analysis; Lows-temperatures; Nano-alloys; Schottky; Schottky-structured coni nano-alloy; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Surface penetration; Binary alloys"

The effect of alloying element on the initial hydrogenation kinetics of TiFe alloys, TiFe0.9M0.1 (M = V, Cr, Fe, Co and Ni), was evaluated by analyzing changes to the passivating surface oxide layer that inhibits hydrogen permeation, as well as the ease of initial-stage hydrogen absorption into the underlying matrix. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atom probe tomography revealed key variations in surface oxide compositions and thinning of the passivating oxide layer compared to pure TiFe, which suggests suppressed oxide growth by alloying-induced elemental redistribution. At the same time, density functional theory calculations predicted exothermic formation of hydride nuclei when alloying with V or Cr, as well as a reduced nucleation barrier when alloying with Co or Ni. Overall, these results are consistent with the observed experimental trend of the activation kinetics. We propose that improvements in activation kinetics of TiFe with alloying arises from the combined effect of reduced passivating oxide thickness and easier hydride nucleation, offering a starting point for alloy design strategies towards further improvement. © 2022 The Author(s)","Activation; Atom probe tomography; Density functional theory calculation; Hydrogen storage; Surface oxide; TiFe alloy","Alloying elements; Binary alloys; Chemical activation; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Density functional theory; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation; Iron alloys; Kinetics; Nickel alloys; Nucleation; Probes; Titanium alloys; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Activation kinetics; Atom-probe tomography; Co/Ni alloy; Density-functional theory calculations; Hydrogen storage materials; Low-costs; Passivating oxides; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Surface oxide; TiFe alloys; Alloying"

In this study, LiH and NaH were ball-milled and the effect of surface area and hydrogen pressure on hydrogen storage capacity was investigated using the solid-state hydrogen storage method. XRD patterns and Raman spectra show significant shifts in main peak positions of LiH and NaH after hydrogen adsorption. BET analysis shows a significant increase in the specific surface area of LiH and NaH from 6.25 m2/g to 12.35 m2/g and from 1.34 m2/g to 2.33 m2/g respectively due to ball milling. The FTIR spectra showed more bonds in the 400–1200 cm⁻1 fingerprint region after storing hydrogen in LiH and NaH. This suggests structural changes with enhanced bond bending due to hydrogen. At 9 bar pressure, LiH and NaH exhibited excellent hydrogen storage, with ball-milled LiH reaching about 3.55 wt% and 652 sccm, and NaH achieving approximately 1.58 wt% and 291 sccm. These results highlight the significant influence of surface area and hydrogen pressure on hydrogen storage potential. Incorporating the storage potential within the evaluation of PEM fuel cell performance, we suggest that an increased storage capacity directly corresponds to an augmented power density. The analysis of power density over time revealed that the hydrogen adsorbed ball-milled LiH exhibited the highest power density, peaking at 0.075 Wcm−2 over the long term. In contrast, LiH displayed a lower power density (0.025 Wcm−2) while maintaining its long-term performance. The hydrogen adsorbed NaH and hydrogen adsorbed ball-milled NaH displayed power densities 0.050 Wcm−2 and 0.073 Wcm−2, respectively, but they showed short-term performance. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Ball milling; Fuel cell; Hydrogen storage; LiH; NaH; PEM","Ball milling; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gas adsorption; Hydrogen bonds; Lithium compounds; Milling (machining); Pressure effects; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Sodium compounds; Ball-milled; Effect of surface area; Hydrogen pressures; Hydrogen storage capacities; PEM; Power densities; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Storage potential; Surface area; Surface hydrogen; Hydrogen storage"

It is found that the Mg(0001)/MgH2(110) interface can weaken the Mg–H bond. The removal energies for hydrogen atoms in the interface zone are significantly lower compared to those of bulk MgH2. In terms of H mobility, hydrogen diffusion within the interface as well as into the Mg matrix is considered.

The hydrogen absorption capacity of the MgH2-FeNi2S4 composite reaches to 4.02 wt% at 373 K for 1 h, a sharp contrast to the milled-MgH2 (0.67 wt%).

The LiAlH4–10 wt% TiSiO4 composite dehydrogenation temperatures were lowered to 92 °C (first-step reaction) and 128 °C (second-step reaction). According to dehydrogenation kinetic analysis, the TiSiO4-added LiAlH4 composite was able to liberate more hydrogen (about 6.0 wt%) than the undoped LiAlH4 composite (less than 1.0 wt%) at 90 °C for 2 h. After the addition of TiSiO4, the activation energies for hydrogen to liberate from LiAlH4 were lowered. Based on the Kissinger equation, the activation energies for hydrogen liberation for the two-step dehydrogenation of post-milled LiAlH4 were 103 and 115 kJ/mol, respectively. After milling LiAlH4 with 10 wt% TiSiO4, the activation energies were reduced to 68 and 77 kJ/mol, respectively. Additionally, the scanning electron microscopy images demonstrated that the LiAlH4 particles shrank and barely aggregated when 10 wt% of TiSiO4 was added.

Hydrogen adsorption kinetics of four different clathrates using promoters Tetrahydrofuran, Tetrahydropyran, 1,3 Dioxolane and 2,3 Dihydrofuran with Multiwall Carbon nanotube as substrate was carried out. The results showed ∼1.5 wt% hydrogen adsorption within 90 min using CNT substrate. This is one of the first reports on usage of CNT as a substrate material for hydrogen storage in clathrate systems. It was observed that CNT shows synergitic effect in the hydrogen adsorption with fast kinetics (less than 90 min). The weight of substrate material (CNT) was also taken into consideration while calculating the weight % of hydrogen adsorption. The present study also involves design and simulation of a hydrogen storage canister (using CNT based clathrate) with embedded helical coolant coils on COMSOL Multiphysics software to analyse the effects of temperature management on improving hydrogen storage capability of the clathrate reactor bed. Results of simulation includes variation of hydrate concentration and temperature in clathrate reactor bed with the passage of time. The theoretical studies pave way for validating the scalability of clatharates as a viable hydrogen energy system. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Clathrates; CNT substrate; Hydrogen storage cannister","Computer software; Gas adsorption; Hydrates; Hydration; Temperature; Cannisters; Clathrates; CNT substrate; Energy; Gaseous state; Hydrogen adsorption; Hydrogen storage cannister; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Storage capability; Substrate material; Hydrogen storage"

However, finding an ideal storage material is the key challenge to the success of the hydrogen economy. Various solid-state hydrogen storage materials, such as metal hydrides, have been developed to realize safe, effective, and compact hydrogen storage. However, low kinetics and thermodynamic stability lead to a high working temperature and a low hydrogen sorption rate of the metal hydrides. Using scaffolds made from porous materials like silica to confine the metal hydrides is necessary for better and improved hydrogen storage. Therefore, this article reviews porous silica-based scaffolds as an ideal material for improved hydrogen storage. The outcome showed that confining the metal hydrides using scaffolds based on porous silica significantly increases their storage capacities. It was also found that the structural modifications of the silica-based scaffold into a hollow structure further improved the storage capacity and increased the affinity and confinement ability of the metal hydrides, which prevents the agglomeration of metal particles during the adsorption/desorption process. Hence, the structural modifications of the silica material into a fibrous and hollow material are recommended to be crucial for further enhancing the metal hydride storage capacity. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","confinement; encapsulation; hydrogen storage; Scaffolds; silica","Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Metal working; Porous materials; Scaffolds; Confinement; Energy landscape; Future energies; Higher energy density; Metal-hydrides; Porous silica; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Storage capacity; Structural modifications; Systematic literature review; Silica"

How to improve hydrogen desorption kinetics of MgH2 is one of key issues for its practical applications. In this study, we synthesize a Mg–Ni–TiS2 composite through a solution-based synthetic strategy. In the as-prepared composite, the co-precipitated Mg and Ni nanoparticles are highly dispersed on TiS2 nanosheets. As a result, the activation energy for hydrogen desorption decreases to 79.4 kJ mol−1. Meanwhile, the capacity retention rate is kept at the level of 98% and only slight kinetic deterioration is caused after fifty hydrogenation-dehydrogenation cycles. Further investigation indicates that the superior hydrogen desorption kinetics is attributed to the synergistically catalytic effect of the in situ formed Mg2NiH4 and TiH2, and the remained TiS2. The excellent cycle stability is related not only to the inhibition effect of the secondary phases on powder agglomeration and crystallite growth of Mg and MgH2 but also to the prevention effect of MgS and TiS2 on redistribution of catalytic Mg2NiH4 and TiH2 nanoparticles during cycling.

Hydrogen is an ideal energy carrier for near future mobility, like automotive applications. Solid-state hydrogen storage materials including nanomaterials and layered systems are the key enablers to the future energy needs. However, the current materials are unable to meet all requirements in the storage capacity and commercialization. The hydrogen storage mechanisms (physical and chemical) are the key-points addressing the shortcomings in hydrogen absorption/adsorption in the interlayer space or on the surface of the material. All above require strategy for designing new hydrogen storage materials. Experiments: This review lays the recent foundations in the materials suitable for hydrogen storage particularly alloys, mixed metal oxides (MMOs), and their respective nanocomposites. Alloys and MMOs are two classes of materials with high discharge capacities, appropriate electrochemical performances, chemical stability, easy production pathways, and almost low cost. In the same vein, highly porous materials with a large surface area such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs), MXenes and carbon materials are thermodynamically and kinetically more favorable. Findings: The literature review illustrates that it is crucial to develop new materials with large-surface area, homogeneous texture, active-conductive profiles, large oxygen vacancies and low-cost. Multiphase materials (nanocomposites/hybrids) composed of at least two of above-mentioned materials can meet the established requirements in this field.

The rapid depletion and higher energy demand consequences an escalation of energy prices originating from conventional sources as well as the release of greenhouse gases into the environment. Hydrogen as an alternative energy source merged as an ideal candidate, distinguished by its remarkable attributes and manifold advantages. It has an exceptional energy density of 120 MJ/kg and encompasses non-toxicity, sustainability, and a favorable environmental profile. Renewable and non-renewable sources can produce hydrogen and have versatile applications in transportation, power generation via fuel cells, and other industrial processes. Beyond having these advantages hydrogen has the benefits of energy security and can be produced locally. Nevertheless, commercial hydrogen has exceptionally low volumetric density under standard conditions which is the major obstacle in the way of its development. To cater this issue and to enhance its economic feasibility, two well-established methodologies are used by alterations in temperature and/or pressure conditions which facilitate the storage of hydrogen either in a pressurized gas or a cryogenic liquid. However, both methods incur energy consumption and pose safety concerns and complexity in the system, which raises the question of having other storage solutions.

In this work, first principles methods were used to understand the structural, electronic, energetic and hydrogen diffusion kinetic properties of pure and Ti-doped Mg(0001)/MgH2(110) interfaces. It is found that Ti interface doping can slightly increase the interfacial stability as revealed by the work of adhesion, interface energy and electronic structure. Additionally, for both the pure and Ti-doped Mg(0001)/MgH2(110) interfaces, the removal energies for the H atoms in the interface zone are significantly low compared with that of bulk MgH2. In terms of H mobility, the Ti dopant is beneficial for H atoms migrating from the inner layers to the interface for aggregation. Furthermore, hydrogen desorption from the two interfaces mainly takes place by hydrogen diffusion within the interface rather than across the interface into the Mg matrix, and Ti doping can enhance this process significantly.

Based on materials properties, Mg hydride is the most promising material to store hydrogen in a solid-state material. The theoretical hydrogen storage capacity of magnesium hydride is 7.6 wt% making it a more suitable material for hydrogen storage in the future. Instead of having high storage capacity, magnesium's practical application as a hydride is limited due to its low kinetics and high working temperature. Aside from the less thermo-stability of bulk MgH2, to achieve the maximum hydrogen storage capacity the decomposition required a higher temperature of about 300 °C with 1 bar pressure. As a result, it is necessary to optimize the stability of hydrogen and magnesium molecules to enhance kinetic and thermodynamic properties. The critical factors in improving hydrogenation properties are decreasing particle size (nano-scale) and adding various catalysts. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

This is the first thorough study about various properties of these materials. These materials were considered as promising potential host materials for solid state hydrogen storage. The evaluation of computed formation enthalpies of MgX3H8 (X = Sc, Ti, Zr), elastic constants, and phonon dispersion graphs revealed that MgX3H8 (X = Sc, Ti, Zr) is thermodynamically, mechanically, and dynamically stable and synthesizable. The analysis of B/G ratio, Cp and Poisson's ratio showed that MgSc3H8 is a brittle material whereas MgTi3H8 and MgZr3H8 are ductile materials. Moreover, anisotropy factor, machinability index, hardness, melting and Debye temperature of the materials were obtained and analysed in depth. The electronic band structures of MgX3H8 (X = Sc, Ti, Zr) illustrated metallic character since the bands (valence and conduction) intersect the Fermi level along the main symmetry directions. The phonon dispersion curves, and the partial state densities of the materials have positive frequencies, therefore, materials are dynamically stable in the cubic structure. The gravimetric hydrogen densities were calculated as 4.60 wt% for MgSc3H8, 4.38 wt% for MgTi3H8 and 2.56 wt% for MgZr3H8. The hydrogen desorption temperatures were computed as 239.54 K for MgSc3H8, 241.76 K for MgTi3H8 and 303.87 K for MgZr3H8. The mechanical properties of the materials suggest that they can be promising host materials for hydrogen storage. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","First principles; Hydrogen storage; Mechanical stability; Physical properties","Computation theory; Density functional theory; Dispersions; Hydrogen storage; Mechanical stability; Phonons; Strain measurement; Titanium; Titanium compounds; Zirconium compounds; Comprehensive properties; Computational evaluation; Density-functional-theory; Electronic dynamics; First principles; Host materials; Hydrogen storage materials; Hydrogen-storage properties; Mechanical; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Magnesium compounds"

Among the various solid-state hydrogen carriers, hydrogen boride (HB) sheets possess a high gravimetric hydrogen capacity (8.5 wt%). However, heating at high temperatures and/or strong ultraviolet illumination is required to release hydrogen (H2) from HB sheets. In this study, the electrochemical H2 release from HB sheets using a dispersion system in an organic solvent without other proton sources is investigated. H2 molecules are released from the HB sheets under the application of a cathodic potential. The Faradaic efficiency for H2 release from HB sheets reached >90%, and the onset potential for H2 release is −0.445 V versus Ag/Ag+, which is more positive than those from other proton sources, such as water or formic acid, under the same electrochemical conditions. The total electrochemically released H2 in a long-time experiment reached ≈100% of the hydrogen capacity of HB sheets. The H2 release from HB sheets is driven by a small bias; thus, they can be applied as safe and lightweight hydrogen carriers with economical hydrogen release properties. © 2024 The Authors.

The high hydrogen uptake capacity (∼12.6 wt%) of lithium hydride (LiH) is limited by the major thermodynamic constraint of requiring a higher temperature (∼700 °C) for desorption at 0.1 MPa. Incorporating a third element that creates Li phases during LiH dehydrogenation can help overcome thermodynamic constraints. This study involves modifying the hydrogen storage properties and thermodynamic characteristics of LiH through mechanical alloying with porous silicon (PS). Pressure composition isotherms measure the reversible hydrogen storage capacity (∼3.39 wt%) of LiH-PS alloy at different temperatures. The energy of hydrogen interaction is quantified by isosteric heat of absorption, which provides the enthalpy change in the reaction system. Hydrogen absorption and desorption enthalpies of 94.5 kJ (mol H2)−1 and 114.9 kJ (mol H2)−1 demonstrate the lowest energy demand among previously reported LiH alloys.

These alloys exhibit a single C14-Laves phase structure and demonstrate promising capabilities for solid-state hydrogen storage. The (Ti0.85Zr0.15)xMn0.8CrFe0.2 (x = 1.00∼1.10) alloys display an increased hydrogen absorption capacity and a reduced plateau pressure at higher super-stoichiometric ratios of x. When x = 1.10, the alloy achieves a maximum capacity of 1.86 wt%. The hydrogen storage capacity of the (Ti0.85Zr0.15)1.02MnyCr1.8-yFe0.2 (y = 1.00∼0.40) alloys diminishes as the value of y decreases. Furthermore, the hydrogen absorption plateau pressure and hysteresis factor of the alloys increase with an escalating Mn/Cr ratio. The analysis of cyclic stability reveals that the primary factor contributing to poor cycling stability of the (Ti0.85Zr0.15)1.02Mn0.4Cr1.4Fe0.2 alloy is the compositional decomposition, rather than pulverization or alterations in the phase structure.

To overcome this problem, we applied the model catalyst, single-atom catalyst with accurately characterizable coordination structure, to understand the interaction between catalyst and MgH2 surface through spin-polarized density-functional theory calculation. We constructed heterogeneous interface structures between single-atom catalysts and MgH2 surface including nine kinds of transition metal atoms. The interaction between single-atom catalysts and MgH2 surface has been well explored through bond length, electron localization function, charge density difference and crystal orbital Hamiltonian population, providing the intrinsic information of H-Mg bond weakening mechanism over single-atom catalysts.

Considering the advantages of hydrogen energy storage in large-scale, cross-seasonal and cross-regional aspects, the necessity, feasibility and economy of hydrogen energy participation in long-time energy storage under the new power system are discussed. Firstly, power supply and demand production simulations were carried out based on the characteristics of new energy generation in China. When the penetration of new energy sources in the new power system reaches 45%, long-term energy storage becomes an essential regulation tool. Secondly, by comparing the storage duration, storage scale and application scenarios of various energy storage technologies, it was determined that hydrogen storage is the most preferable choice to participate in large-scale and long-term energy storage. Three long-time hydrogen storage methods are screened out from numerous hydrogen storage technologies, including salt-cavern hydrogen storage, natural gas blending and solid-state hydrogen storage. Finally, by analyzing the development status and economy of the above three types of hydrogen storage technologies, and based on the geographical characteristics and resource endowment of China, it is pointed out that China will form a hydrogen storage system of “solid state hydrogen storage above ground and salt cavern storage underground” in the future. © 2023 by the authors.","hydrogen blending of natural gas; hydrogen storage; long-term energy storage; new power systems; salt cave hydrogen storage; solid state hydrogen storage","Blending; Economics; Hydrogen storage; Natural gas; Underground gas storage; Wind power; Hydrogen blending of natural gas; Hydrogen storage technologies; Large-scales; Long-term energy storage; New energy sources; New power system; Power; Salt cave hydrogen storage; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Time energy; Caves"

Solid-state hydrogen storage is a catching-on and intensively researched alternative to other methods for storing hydrogen. Perovskite hydrides exhibit the ability to store solid-state hydrogen safely and effectively. This work employs the first-principles calculations to investigate the physical properties of LiCaF3˗αHα (α = 0,1,2,3) perovskite compounds, aiming to elucidate insights into their potential in hydrogen storage applications. To assess the phase stability, we computed the formation enthalpies, which indicate that all compounds are stable and can be synthesized experimentally. Notably, the optimized lattice parameter decreased from 4.42 to 4.32 Å when an impurity was added to pristine material. Additionally, the evaluation of the elastic stiffness constants manifests that all LiCaF3-αHα compounds are mechanically stable and brittle in nature. Investigations of electronic properties demonstrate the narrowing in the bandgap of the host compound with the inclusion of H. To gain insight into how the absorption edge shifts towards the valence band and causes the band gap to diminish, the Burstein-Moss shift and band gap renormalization were investigated. Interestingly, the gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen storage capacities have been improved up to 6.04 wt% and 61.77 gH2l−1, respectively, which are fulfilling the target set by DOE for 2025.

However, LiAlH4 suffers from slow kinetics and irreversibility. Hence, LaCoO3 was selected as an additive to defeat the slow kinetics problems of LiAlH4. For the irreversibility part, it still required high pressure to absorb hydrogen. Thus, this study focused on the reduction of the onset desorption temperature and the quickening of the desorption kinetics of LiAlH4. Here, we report the different weight percentages of LaCoO3 mixed with LiAlH4 using the ball-milling method. Interestingly, the addition of 10 wt.% of LaCoO3 resulted in a decrease in the desorption temperature to 70 °C for the first stage and 156 °C for the second stage. In addition, at 90 °C, LiAlH4 + 10 wt.% LaCoO3 can desorb 3.37 wt.% of H2 in 80 min, which is 10 times faster than the unsubstituted samples. The activation energies values for this composite are greatly reduced to 71 kJ/mol for the first stages and 95 kJ/mol for the second stages compared to milled LiAlH4 (107 kJ/mol and 120 kJ/mol for the first two stages, respectively). The enhancement of hydrogen desorption kinetics of LiAlH4 is attributed to the in situ formation of AlCo and La or La-containing species in the presence of LaCoO3, which resulted in a reduction of the onset desorption temperature and activation energies of LiAlH4. © 2023 by the authors.","LaCoO<sub>3</sub>; LiAlH<sub>4</sub>; metal oxide; solid-state hydrogen storage","Activation energy; Aluminum compounds; Ball milling; Binary alloys; Desorption; Hydrogen storage; Kinetics; % reductions; Desorption kinetics; Desorption properties; Desorption temperatures; High pressure; Hydrogen storage capacities; Kinetic problems; Metal-oxide; Moderate temperature; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Lithium compounds"

Here, we prepared the Ni/C nanoparticles anchored on large-size Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, firstly introduced into LiAlH4 to investigate its catalytic effect. Dehydrogenation experiments demonstrate that LiAlH4 doped with 7 wt% Ni/C@Ti3C2 starts to release hydrogen at 56.9 °C. Also, it can release about 4.3 wt% hydrogen within 50 min at 120 °C.

Our framework includes two ML models that predict the hydrogen storage capacity (HYST) and the enthalpy of hydride formation (THOR) of multi-component metal alloys. We demonstrate that a chemically diverse set of features effectively describes the hydrogen storage properties of the alloys. In HYST, we use absorption temperature as a feature which improved H2wt% prediction significantly. For out-of-the-bag samples, HYST predicted H2wt% with R2 score of 0.81 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.45 wt% whereas R2 score is 0.89 and MAE is 4.53 kJ/molH2 for THOR. These models are further employed to predict H2wt% and ΔH for ∼ 6.4 million multi-component metal alloys. We have identified 6480 compositions with superior storage properties (H2wt% > 2.5 at room temperature and ΔH < 60 kJ/molH2). We have also discussed in detail the interesting trends picked up by these models like temperature dependent variation in the rate of hydrogenation and alloying effect on H2wt% and ΔH in different families of alloys. Importantly certain elements like Al, Si, Sc, Cr, and Mn when mixed in small fractions with hydriding elements like Mg, Ti, V etc. systematically reduce ΔH without significantly compromising the storage capacity. Further upon increasing the number of elements in the alloy i.e from binary to ternary to quaternary, the number of compositions with lower enthalpies also increases. From the 6.4 million compositions, we have reported new alloy families having potential for hydrogen storage at room temperature.

The temperature-programmed desorption study shows that the onset desorption temperature of MgH2 catalyzed by VS2 and MgH2 catalyzed by Gr is 289 °C and 300 °C, respectively. These desorption temperatures are 87 °C and 76 °C lower than the desorption temperature of pristine MgH2. The rapid rehydrogenation kinetics for the MgH2 catalyzed by VS2 have been found at a temperature of 300 °C under 15 atm H2 pressure by absorbing ∼4.04 wt% of hydrogen within 1 min, whereas the MgH2 catalyzed by Gr takes ∼3 min for absorbing the same amount of hydrogen under the similar temperature and pressure conditions. The faster release of hydrogen was also observed in MgH2 catalyzed by VS2 than MgH2 catalyzed by Gr and pristine MgH2. MgH2 catalyzed by VS2 releases ∼2.54 wt% of hydrogen within 10 min, while MgH2 catalyzed by Gr takes ∼30 min to release the same amount of hydrogen.

The absorption of hydrogen in MH is highly exothermic. Hence, a good heat management system is required to increase the charging rate. The phase change material (PCM) can be integrated into the reactor to reuse the absorption heat for hydrogen desorption. The present numerical study models the concentric cylindrical reactor with magnesium (Mg) as MH surrounded by sodium nitrate (NaNO3) as PCM using COMSOL Multiphysics v6.1. The effect of buoyancy inside the PCM domain is investigated. An iterative approach is used to determine the required amount of PCM. Copper fins are added inside both MH and PCM. The effect of the number of fins, corresponding fin thickness and pitch on hydrogen absorption are determined to optimize the MH reactor. The outcomes reveal that the hydrogen absorption rate increases with fin numbers. The reactor with 10 and 30 fins takes 86.5 and 97.3 % less time than without fins for 90 % hydrogen absorption, respectively. The novel approach is proposed to estimate the fin efficiency (ηf) using temperature profiles of MH and fin during prevailing unsteady heat and mass transfer.

The present study determines the thermal stability, hydrogen dissociation energy, and electronic structures of alkali metal aluminum hydrides, MAlH4 (M = Li, Na, K, and Cs), using first-principles density functional theory calculations in an attempt to gain insight into the dehydrogenation mechanism of these hydrides. The results show that the hydrogen dissociation energy (Ed-H2) of MAlH4 (M = Li, Na, K, and Cs) correlates with the Pauling electronegativity of cation M (χP); that is, the Ed-H2 (average value) decreases, i.e., 1.211 eV (LiAlH4) < 1.281 eV (NaAlH4) < 1.291 eV (KAlH4) < 1.361 eV (CsAlH4), with the increasing χP value, i.e., 0.98 (Li) > 0.93 (Na) > 0.82 (K) > 0.79 (Cs). The main reason for this finding is that alkali alanate MAlH4 at higher cation electronegativity is thermally less stable and held by weaker Al-H covalent and H-H ionic interactions. Our work contributes to the design of alkali metal aluminum hydrides with a favorable dehydrogenation, which is useful for on-board hydrogen storage. © 2023 by the authors.","alkali metal aluminum hydrides; cation electronegativity; dehydrogenation performance; electronic structure; first-principles calculations","Aluminum compounds; Chemical bonds; Dehydrogenation; Density functional theory; Dissociation; Electronegativity; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Lithium compounds; Positive ions; Sodium compounds; Alkali metal aluminum hydride; Cation electronegativity; Dehydrogenation performance; Dissociation energies; Electronic.structure; First principle calculations; Hydrogen capacities; Hydrogen dissociation; Performance; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Electronic structure"

It has a high energy density and is a source of clean energy. A crucial step in the development of the hydrogen economy is the safety and affordable storage of a large amount of hydrogen. Thus, owing to its large storage capacity, good reversibility, and low cost, Magnesium hydride (MgH2) was taken into consideration. Unfortunately, MgH2 has a high desorption temperature and slow ab/desorption kinetics. Using the ball milling technique, adding cobalt lanthanum oxide (LaCoO3) to MgH2 improves its hydrogen storage performance. The results show that adding 10 wt.% LaCoO3 relatively lowers the starting hydrogen release, compared with pure MgH2 and milled MgH2. On the other hand, faster ab/desorption after the introduction of 10 wt.% LaCoO3 could be observed when compared with milled MgH2 under the same circumstances. Besides this, the apparent activation energy for MgH2–10 wt.% LaCoO3 was greatly reduced when compared with that of milled MgH2. From the X-ray diffraction analysis, it could be shown that in-situ forms of MgO, CoO, and La2O3, produced from the reactions between MgH2 and LaCoO3, play a vital role in enhancing the properties of hydrogen storage of MgH2. © 2023 by the authors.","cobalt lanthanum oxide; magnesium hydride; metal oxide; solid-state hydrogen storage","Activation energy; Ball milling; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Magnesia; X ray powder diffraction; Clean energy; Energy carriers; Higher energy density; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen-storage properties; Large amounts; Metal-oxide; Solid state method; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Synthesised; Cobalt compounds"

It was demonstrated that the morphology of catalysts and addition of Mn had a great impact on the performance of HEAs catalysts. In particular, the Mn containing HEAs nanosheets presented the best performance. The MgH2-CrMnFeCoNi composite could release 6.5 wt% H2 in 10 min at 300 °C and started to absorb H2 at 40 °C. Moreover, kinetic analysis revealed that the rate control model in dehydrogenation process of HEA-4 modified MgH2 changed from permeation model of MgH2 to diffusion. In addition, 97% hydrogen storage volume could be maintained after 20 cycles at 300 °C, showing a good cycling performance. Microstructure analysis showed that the CrMnFeCoNi nanosheets were uniform dispersed over the surface of MgH2, bringing numerous heterogeneous activation sites to speed up the dispersal of hydrogen. Besides, the cocktail effect of HEAs exerted synergic action between Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni elements to improve the overall catalytic efficiency.

One of the most effective solutions in improving hydrogen storage properties of MgH2 is to introduce a suitable catalyst. Herein, a novel nanoparticulate ZrNi with 10-60 nm in size was successfully prepared by co-precipitation followed by a molten-salt reduction process. The 7 wt % nano-ZrNi-catalyzed MgH2 composite desorbs 6.1 wt % hydrogen starting from ∼178 °C after activation, lowered by 99 °C relative to the pristine MgH2 (∼277 °C). The dehydrided sample rapidly absorbs ∼5.5 wt % H2 when operating at 150 °C for 8 min. The remarkably improved hydrogen storage properties are reasonably ascribed to the in situ formation of ZrH2, ZrNi2, and Mg2NiH4 caused by the disproportionation reaction of nano-ZrNi during the first de-/hydrogenation cycle. These catalytic active species are uniformly dispersed in the MgH2 matrix, thus creating a multielement, multiphase, and multivalent environment, which not only largely favors the breaking and rebonding of H-H bonds and the transfer of electrons between H- and Mg2+ but also provides multiple hydrogen diffusion channels.

The favorable interaction between V6O13 nanobelts and MgH2 leads to in situ homogeneous formation of metallic V during the initial dehydrogenation of MgH2. Induced by the catalysis of metallic V, which results in weaker structural stability and higher surface states of MgH2 attributed to the strong bonding interactions between V and H, the energy required for H2 desorption from MgH2 is decreased to 49.5 kJ mol−1, 10.9 kJ mol−1 lower than that of pristine MgH2. Moreover, during the reversible hydrogenation process, the catalysis of metallic V lowers the energy for H2 adsorption and dissociation on Mg down to −5.904 and 0.023 eV, respectively, while those values reach −0.086 and 1.103 eV for pristine Mg.

In this paper, the structure and hydrogen storage properties of the LaNi5+nAlH3 (n = 0, 1, 3 wt.%) composites were investigated. The results show that with the incremental of AlH3 alloying content, the lattice constant a, b, and c and the volume (V) of the LaNi5 unit cell tend to increase, the hydrogen absorption platform pressure of the composite material gradually decreased, and the hydrogen release platform pressure gradually increased. It resulted in a reduction in the hysteresis factor (Hf) of the composite from 0.66 to 0.35. This will reduce energy waste during energy conversion.

Isothermal desorption kinetics also revealed that faster desorption kinetics can be observed at 90 °C for 120 min LiAlH4+10 wt% of Ni0.6Zn0.4O can desorb 3.1 wt% of H2, whereas undoped LiAlH4 can release approximately less than 0.5 wt% of H2 in the same time frame. According to the Kissinger method, the apparent activation energies for the first two steps of the LiAlH4+10 wt% of Ni0.6Zn0.4O composites have been found to be 73 kJ/mol and 85 kJ/mol, respectively, 32 kJ/mol and 40 kJ/mol less than milled LiAlH4. The in-situ formation of NiO and Zn or Zn-containing compounds during the heating process might contribute to the kinetic improvement of LiAlH4. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Additive; Lithium alanate; Metal oxide; Solid-state hydrogen storage","Activation energy; Desorption; Hydrogen storage; Kinetics; Lithium compounds; Nickel oxide; Zinc compounds; Decomposition temperature; Desorption kinetics; Desorption properties; Hydrogen capacities; Hydrogen storage materials; Hydrogen storage medium; Lithium alanate; Metal-oxide; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Synthesised; Aluminum compounds"

However, their slow kinetics and highly unfavorable thermodynamics make them unsuitable for the practical applications. The current study describes the unusual catalytic action of a new class of catalyst, a high-entropy alloy (HEA) of Al20Cr16Mn16Fe16Co16Ni16 and its leached version, on the de/re-hydrogenation properties of MgH2. The onset desorption temperature of MgH2 was reduced significantly from 360 °C (for ball-milled MgH2) to 338 °C when it was catalyzed with a leached HEA-based catalyst. On the other hand, a fast de/re-hydrogenation kinetics of MgH2 was observed during the addition of leached HEA-based catalyst. It absorbed ∼6.1 wt% of hydrogen in just 2 min at a temperature of 300 °C under 10 atm hydrogen pressure and desorbed ∼5.4 wt% within 40 min. At moderate temperatures and low pressure, the HEA-based catalyst reduced desorption temperatures and improved re-hydrogenation kinetics. Even after 25 cycles of de/re-hydrogenation, the storage capacity of MgH2 catalyzed with the leached version of HEA degrades negligibly. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","High entropy alloys; Intermetallic compounds; MgH<sub>2</sub>; Solid-state hydrogen storage","Catalysis; Catalysts; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Desorption; Entropy; High-entropy alloys; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Iron alloys; Kinetics; Leaching; Manganese alloys; Temperature; 'current; Desorption temperatures; High entropy alloys; Hydrogen sorption; Hydrogenation kinetics; Hydrogenation properties; Intermetallics compounds; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Sorption properties; ]+ catalyst; Intermetallics"

On the other hand, its reactivity with CO2 is still unclear, especially in the solid state. By carefully controlling the CO2 pressure and temperature, AB efficiently reduces a large amount of CO2 without solvent or catalyst. 40 mmol of CO2 reacts with one mole of AB at 0.5 MPa and 60 °C. The mechanism was investigated by NMR and DFT calculation. The reaction proceeds through the formation of diammoniate of diborane (DADB) as an intermediate, followed by the reduction and fixation of CO2 with BH4− to give triformatoborohydride ([HB(OCHO)3]−). Aldehyde is then transferred from B to N, yielding formamide as the main final product. The N-formylation of secondary amine can also be achieved without solvent.

The need to efficiently produce and store hydrogen, therefore, has necessitated the development of several technologies and materials for hydrogen storage to achieve the envisaged hydrogen economy. Solid-state hydrogen storage in magnesium hydride (MgH2) has shown a huge potential owing to its impressively high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen capacities of ca. 7.6 wt% and 111 g/L, respectively. However, the bottleneck to the wide applications of MgH2 as a commercial source of hydrogen fuel is the delivery temperature requirement of ca. 300-400°C due to thermodynamic stability (ca. 76 kJ/mol-H2), and the slow kinetics of hydrogen de/absorption. Nanostructuring and catalysis are marked as the most promising strategies for modifying the properties of MgH2. Doping MgH2 with nanoscale materials can lower the delivery temperature and bring it nearer to commercial applications. Recently, MXenes, a group of 2D nanomaterials composed of transition metal carbides/nitrides/carbonitrides layers, have demonstrated the dual roles of storing hydrogen and enhancing the hydrogen evolution reactions of lightweight metal hydrides especially MgH2.

In order to realize the large-scale application of hydrogen energy, the problem of hydrogen storage must be solved. At present, there are three main ways of hydrogen storage, namely compressed hydrogen storage, liquid hydrogen storage, and solid-state hydrogen storage. Compressed hydrogen storage is the most commonly used hydrogen storage method. After the hydrogen is compressed, it is stored in the form of gas in a cylinder. It has the advantages of low cost and fast charging and discharging speed, but its volumetric hydrogen storage density is extremely low. Liquid hydrogen storage is a cryogenic hydrogen storage technology. After the hydrogen is compressed, it is cryogenically cooled to below −253°C to become liquid hydrogen for storage. Liquid hydrogen has the advantages of high storage efficiency and good volumetric hydrogen storage density, but the liquefaction of hydrogen requires a lot of energy, so its storage cost is high. Solid-state hydrogen storage technology is one of the most promising hydrogen storage technologies, which utilizes the physical adsorption or chemical reaction characteristics between hydrogen and materials to store hydrogen. It has the advantages of good safety and high volumetric hydrogen storage density. Therefore, solid-state hydrogen storage is considered to be one of the most promising hydrogen storage technologies. However, in order to develop solid-state hydrogen storage technology, we must find and develop high-performance hydrogen storage materials, which have become a top priority. The current chapter mainly presents an overview of the developments of three hydrogen storage technologies.

It discovered that the mixture of Na3AlH6 and LiBH4 reacted through a metathesis reaction and transformed into Li3AlH6 and NaBH4 composite upon the ball milling procedure. MgH2-Li3AlH6-NaBH4 destabilized system with TiF3 catalyst has displayed four decomposition tiers throughout the heating procedure. The initial tier of hydrogen release in the composite occurs at temperatures of 100 °C and 75 °C lower than in the catalyst-free composite. Continuous heating resulted in two through four dehydrogenation tiers, with an overall capacity of 10.1 wt% hydrogens released (at temperatures of 200 °C, 350 °C, and 400 °C, respectively). In contrast to the Mg-Na-Al-Li-B-H catalyst-free composite, incorporating the TiF3 catalyst demonstrates a faster hydrogen uptake and release rate. The apparent activation energy (Ea) for the dissociation of Li3AlH6, MgH2, and NaBH4 in the composite with TiF3 catalyst was remarkably abridged compared to the catalyst-free ternary system (Kissinger plot; 23, 20, and 13 kJ/mol, respectively for doped composite).

The hydrogen trapping processes, together with hydrogen charging, are numerically simulated using the implicit iterative algorithm of the self-defined finite elements. Some important results are attained: 1. Hydrogen can overcome the energy barrier under the assistance of the local elastic driving force and then spontaneously enter the trap site from the lattice site. The high binding energy makes it difficult for the trapped hydrogens to escape. 2. The secondary phase geometry stress concentration significantly induces the hydrogen to overcome the energy barrier. 3. The manipulation of the geometry, volume fraction, dimension, and type of the secondary phases is capable of dictating the tradeoff between the hydrogen storage capacity and the hydrogen charging rate.

HEAs with the C14 Laves phase have shown a high potential to reversibly store hydrogen at room temperature, but most of these alloys require a high-temperature activation treatment. This study explores the role of interphase boundaries on the easy activation of HEAs at room temperature. Two chemically similar HEAs with single and dual phases, TiV1.5ZrCr0.5MnFeNi (C14 + 4 vol% BCC phases) and TiV1.5Zr1.5CrMnFeNi (single C14 phase), are designed and synthesized.

Experimental results demonstrated that 9wt% FeCoNiCrMo doped MgH2 started to de-hydrogenate at 200°C and discharged up to 5.89wt% hydrogen within 60 min at 325°C. The fully dehydrogenated composite could absorb 3.23wt% hydrogen in 50 min at a temperature as low as 100°C. The calculated de/hydrogenation activation energy values decreased by 44.21%/55.22% compared with MgH2, respectively. Moreover, the composite’s hydrogen capacity dropped only 0.28wt% after 20 cycles, demonstrating remarkable cycling stability. The microstructure analysis verified that the five elements, Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, and Mo, remained stable in the form of high entropy alloy during the cycling process, and synergistically serving as a catalytic union to boost the de/hydrogenation reactions of MgH2. Besides, the FeCoNiCrMo nanosheets had close contact with MgH2, providing numerous non-homogeneous activation sites and diffusion channels for the rapid transfer of hydrogen, thus obtaining a superior catalytic effect. © 2023, University of Science and Technology Beijing.","catalysis; high entropy alloy; hydrogen storage; magnesium hydride; nano-sheets","Activation energy; Catalysis; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Entropy; High-entropy alloys; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage alloys; Iron alloys; Magnesium compounds; Nanosheets; Ternary alloys; Catalytic effects; Composite(s); Cycling stability; Energy value; High entropy alloys; Hydrogen capacities; Microstructures analysis; Nano sheet; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Storage performance; Hydrogen storage"

However, the practical utilization of hydrogen energy depends partly on safe and efficient hydrogen storage techniques. The development of hydrogen storage materials has attracted extensive interest for decades. Solid-state hydrogen storage systems based on metal hydride materials provide great promises for many applications. Recently, interest has been revived in TiFe alloys as a prime candidate for stationary hydrogen storage material. The advantages of TiFe alloys over some of the other solid metal hydrides include that it can hydrogenate and dehydrogenate at near room temperature under near atmospheric pressures and that it is a low-cost material because there are abundant supplies of Fe and Ti on the earth's crust. However, the TiFe alloy must be activated at relatively high temperatures (400–450 °C) and high pressure of hydrogen (65 bar) before it can be hydrogenated, which is a hindrance to the industrial-scale application of TiFe alloys. The materials science community on hydrogen storage materials has conducted and reported considerable amounts of studies on TiFe-based alloys. In this work, we provided a comprehensive review of TiFe-based alloys. The fundamentals and synthesis approaches of TiFe-based alloys were summarized. The activation properties of TiFe-based alloys including the understanding of the activation mechanisms and the methods for improving the activation kinetics were reviewed. Moreover, the cycle stability and anti-poisoning ability were discussed. Finally, the potential applications and the perspective of TiFe-based alloys were introduced. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Activation properties; Applications; Hydrogen storage; Metal hydrides; Synthesis methods; TiFe alloy","Atmospheric pressure; Binary alloys; Chemical activation; Fossil fuels; Hydrides; Hydrogenation; Iron alloys; Structural geology; Titanium alloys; Activation property; Hydrogen storage materials; Metal-hydrides; Process applications; Process properties; Storage structures; Structure property; Structure/process; Synthesis method; TiFe alloys; Hydrogen storage"

Magnesium hydride (MgH2), amongst other materials, shows excellent hydrogen storage capability. However, it suffers from setbacks like sluggish kinetics and high thermodynamic stability. Several studies have shown that doping with suitable materials is an effective method to improve the sorption kinetics. Current work is concerned with doping of MgH2 with perovskite-type ternary metal oxide NaNbO3 at 5,10 & 15 wt% doping concentration via ball milling and study of its sorption properties. Thermal desorption mass spectra (TDMS) with thermogravimetry (TG) and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) validate the optimum doping concentration to be 10 wt% NaNbO3 in MgH2. According to the isothermal hydrogenation plots, 10 wt% catalyzed sample was capable of absorbing 5.29 wt% hydrogen in just 4.2 min at 150ºC which by far outperforms the 2 h milled MgH2 sample which under the same set of conditions absorbs only 0.67 wt% H2. The catalyst starts affecting the absorption rate right from the room temperature whereas the milled sample has minimal absorption throughout the experiment. At room temperature, the average rate of absorption grows by factor 7 which is staggeringly high. The Kissinger analysis reveals activation energy for hydrogen release as 73.12 kJ/mol for 10 wt% doped NaNbO3-MgH2 system while 137.13 kJ/mol for as milled MgH2. The pressure-temperature isotherm (PCI) at four different temperatures gives a quantitative measure of the thermodynamic stability of the system. To fully comprehend the catalytic process, XRD, SEM, and XPS analysis were conducted after each stage of experiment. XPS suggested possible reduction of Nb valance state from + 5 to + 2 due to surface reduction reaction which further accelerated the sorption kinetics due to the electron transfer process. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Catalytic mechanism; Hydrogen storage; MgH2; NaNbO3; Sorption kinetics","Activation analysis; Catalysis; Dehydrogenation; Differential scanning calorimetry; Electron transport properties; Hydrogen storage; Isotherms; Kinetics; Magnesium compounds; Mass spectrometry; Niobium compounds; Perovskite; Sodium compounds; Surface reactions; System stability; Thermodynamic stability; Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Catalytic mechanisms; Doping concentration; Hydrogen Energy; Hydrogen sorption kinetics; Large-scales; Sluggish kinetics; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Sorption kinetics; Storage capability; Ternary oxides; Activation energy"

Yet, its stable thermodynamics and sluggish kinetics are unfavorable for that required for commercial application. Herein, nickel/vanadium trioxide (Ni/V2O3) nanoparticles with heterostructures were successfully prepared via hydrogenating the NiV-based two-dimensional layered double hydroxide (NiV-LDH). MgH2 + 7 wt% Ni/V2O3 presented more superior hydrogen absorption and desorption performances than pure MgH2 and MgH2 + 7 wt% NiV-LDH. The initial discharging temperature of MgH2 was significantly reduced to 190 °C after adding 7 wt% Ni/V2O3, which was 22 and 128 °C lower than that of 7 wt% NiV-LDH modified MgH2 and additive-free MgH2, respectively. The completely dehydrogenated MgH2 + 7 wt% Ni/V2O3 charged 5.25 wt% H2 in 20 min at 125 °C, while the hydrogen absorption capacity of pure MgH2 only amounted to 4.82 wt% H2 at a higher temperature of 200 °C for a longer time of 60 min.

Diverse strategies have emerged in recent years to address this challenge. MgH2 has stood out as a promising solid-state hydrogen storage material due to its impressive gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen density, but its practical application is hampered by elevated thermal stability and sluggish kinetics. In this study, we introduce a solution by synthesizing Pd metallene through a one-pot solvothermal method, revealing a distinctive highly curved lamellar structure with a thickness of around 1.6 nm. Incorporating this Pd metallene into MgH2 results in a composite system wherein the starting dehydrogenation temperature is significantly lowered to 439 K and complete dehydrogenation occurs at 583 K, releasing 6.14 wt.% hydrogen. The activation energy of dehydrogenation for MgH2 was reduced from 170.4 kJ mol–1 to 79.85 kJ mol–1 after Pd metallene decoration. The enthalpy of dehydrogenation of the MgH2–10 wt.% Pd sample was calculated to be 73 kJ mol–1 H2 –1 and decreased by 4.4 kJ mol–1 H2 –1 from that of dehydrogenation of pure MgH2 (77.4 kJ mol–1 H2 –1). Theoretical calculations show that the average formation energy and average adsorption energy of hydrogen vacancies can be significantly reduced in the presence of both Pd clusters and Pd single atoms on the surface of MgH2/Mg, respectively. It suggests that the synergistic effect of in situ formed Pd single atoms and clusters significantly improves the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation kinetics.

With the presence of Zn2TiO4, the starting temperature for the dehydrogenation of MgH2 was remarkably lowered to around 290 °C–305 °C.

One effective method to enhance heat transfer is utilizing an HTS equipped with fins and a cooling tube. Among the crucial factors for optimizing the reactor, fin efficiency (FE) plays a vital role, although it has not been explored in unsteady processes like the present one. This study introduces a novel FE technique to optimize fins in a conventional longitudinal finned tube MH reactor based on LaNi5. Due to the intricacies of the problem, making analytical estimation of FE challenging, the authors turned to the concept of reverse engineering. This approach utilizes simulated data's temporal temperature profiles to calculate the FE. The number of fins is varied from 4 to 12 while keeping the total fin weight constant. Heat transfer performance improved as the number of fins increased, but the FE deteriorated from 0.89 to 0.56 due to the reduction in fin thickness. A performance index (PI) that considers the number of fins is introduced to assess the overall performance. Its values are 0.58, 0.79, 0.96, 1.05, and 1.1 for configurations with 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 fins, respectively. The configuration with 8 fins is deemed optimal because further increasing the number of fins led to only marginal improvements in PI value. Subsequent optimization of fin shape, precisely radial tapering, had a minimal impact on heat transfer performance. Finally, the desorption behavior was examined for the optimal configuration with 8 fins of constant thickness. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Absorption; Heat transfer; Longitudinal fins; Metal hydride; Performance index; Radial tapering","Digital storage; Efficiency; Fins (heat exchange); Heat transfer; Hydrides; Mass transfer; Reverse engineering; Fin efficiency; Heat transfer performance; Heat transfer systems; Heat-driven; Hydrogen charging; Longitudinal fin; Metal-hydrides; Performance indices; Radial tapering; Solid-state hydrogen storage; detection method; heat transfer; instrumentation; mass transfer; optimization; performance assessment; temperature effect; Hydrogen storage"

The article initiates with brief but sufficiently explanatory discussions on the rudiments of hydrogen sorption in MgH2 followed by an elaborate exposition on the usage of catalyst as a possible means to alleviate some of the shortcomings of the virgin compound. This article assesses a number of factors affecting the catalytic efficiency, e.g., defect density, valance state of the metal ion, oxygen vacancy, etc., which dictates the metal oxide-based catalysts as a prime candidate in this regard.

Traditional hydrogen energy systems are suffered from low density, high production cost, low efficiency, and storage complications. With the start of solid-state hydrogen storage technology, many of above deficiencies are fulfilled, however, there are several unknown points, particularly in metal oxides, which need more attention. Hydrogen sorption on the layered materials or inside porous materials is a hopeful key to drawbacks for high-performance hydrogen sorption. Hereupon, layered solids with the merit of hydrogen sorption are introduced, for the first time, including “nanostructured bi-metal oxide (BMO)” and “graphitic carbon nitride (CN)”. Perovskites are ceramic and they are hard materials so they could be a favorable candidate for solid-state hydrogen storage. g-C3N4 has attractive features including high surface area, chemical stability, small band gap, and low-cost synthesis methods but also has great potential as an electrode material for energy storage capacitors. The main motivation for this study comes from the potential applications for perovskite materials and graphitic carbon nitride for the solid-state hydrogen storage method. The Perovskite type GdFeO3 nanostructures (as BMO) synthesized through sol-gel approach in front of natural source of Grape juice as both complexing agent and fuel. The experimental scrutinization ascertains an original fabrication of GdFeO3 (GF) nanostructures in Grape juice at 800 °C, with an approximately uniform nanosized structure of 70 nm on average. The obtained pure GF nanostructures are then utilized for nanocomposite formation based on g-C3N4 (CN) with different amounts.

It should be declared that however, the discharge capacity of the nanostructured GF is 188 mAhg−1. It can be emphasized that these GF/CN nanocomposites can be utilized as hopeful hosts in an electrochemical hydrogen storage setup due to the synergic effect of g-C3N4 with essential characteristics in cooperation with BMO nanostructures as acceptable electrocatalysts. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","G-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>; garnet; Green synthesis; Hydrogen storage; Physicochemical properties","Chemical stability; Electric discharges; Electrolytes; Energy gap; Gadolinium compounds; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen storage; Iron compounds; Nanocomposites; Nanostructures; Nitrides; Perovskite; Potassium hydroxide; G-C3N4; Grape juice; Graphitic carbon nitrides; Green synthesis; Hydrogen sorption; Metal-oxide; Nano-structured; Physicochemical property; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Synthesised; Physicochemical properties"

The latter encompass two classes of kinetics for adsorption/desorption and chemical reactions - fast and Marcelin-De Donder, and the second class includes mass action kinetics as a special case. We apply the framework to derive a system consisting of the standard diffusion equation in bulk and FitzHugh-Nagumo type surface reaction-diffusion system of equations on the boundary. We also study the linear stability of a homogeneous steady state in a spherical region and establish sufficient conditions for the occurrence of instabilities driven by surface diffusion. These findings are verified through numerical simulations which reveal that instabilities driven by diffusion lead to the emergence of steady-state spatial patterns from random initial conditions and that bulk diffusion can suppress spatial patterns, in which case temporal oscillations can ensue.

In this work, a novel nanostructured ZrFe2 (nano-ZrFe2) measuring 30-120 nm in size was designed and fabricated as a catalyst precursor, which was readily converted into ultrafine ZrH2 and metallic Fe nanoparticles upon ball milling with MgH2 and first de-/hydrogenation, consequently delivering quite high catalytic activity for hydrogen storage in MgH2. MgH2 containing 10 wt% nano-ZrFe2 desorbed 6.2 wt% of H2 starting from approximately 193 °C, which was lowered by 35 °C with respect to the micron-ZrFe2-modified MgH2 (∼228 °C). When operated at a hydrogen pressure of 50 bars, the dehydrogenated sample absorbed ∼5.3 wt% of H2 at 200 °C within 30 minutes. The remarkably improved kinetic properties of MgH2 are mainly attributed to the ultrasmall nanoparticles and uniform, dispersive distribution of in situ formed ZrH2 and Fe. Such in situ conversion of nano-ZrFe2 not only provided a multiphase and multiscale catalytic environment that enabled high reactivity and catalytic activity but also facilitated H diffusion owing to increased interfaces, consequently promoting the dissociation and recombination of H2 molecules. These important insights in the new nanoscaled intermetallics broaden the scope of the design and synthesis of much higher active catalysts for hydrogen storage in light-metal hydrides, especially in MgH2 © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Ball milling; Binary alloys; Catalyst activity; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Nanocatalysts; Nanoparticles; Zirconium compounds; Active catalyst; Hydrogen storage medium; Large amounts; Mobile applications; Multiphases; Nano-structured; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Stationary applications; Storage performance; ]+ catalyst; Magnesium compounds"

The thermodynamic properties calculation shows that applying uniaxial and biaxial strains on the H2-free magnesium does not significantly affect the formation enthalpy and decomposition temperature of the hydride phase. On the other hand, strain energy contributions on preliminarily hydrogenated magnesium are found able to decrease and improve the formation enthalpy and the decomposition temperature, making it feasible for the operational conditions of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells at 289 – 393 K. Also, the findings demonstrate that the kinetic properties in terms of hydrogen atom diffusion show a decrease in the activation energy barrier, which means an improvement in the kinetics properties faster than that of strain-free magnesium hydride. These results potentially provide better clues for the development of a magnesium-based metal hydride for hydrogen storage applications. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Density functional theory; Hydrogen storage; Mechanical treatment; MgH<sub>2</sub>; Thermodynamic properties","Activation energy; Atoms; Enthalpy; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation; Magnesium compounds; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Strain; Biaxial strains; Decomposition temperature; Density functional theory studies; Density-functional-theory; Formation enthalpy; Kinetic properties; Mechanical treatments; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Thermodynamics property; Uniaxial strains; Density functional theory"

However, the high hydrogen desorption temperature (more than 400 °C) and slow sorption kinetics of MgH2 are the main obstacles to its practical use. In this research, nickel zinc oxide (Ni0.6Zn0.4O) was synthesized via the solid-state method and doped into MgH2 to overcome the drawbacks of MgH2. The onset desorption temperature of the MgH2–10 wt.% Ni0.6Zn0.4O sample was reduced to 285 °C, 133 °C, and 56 °C lower than that of pure MgH2 and milled MgH2, respectively. Furthermore, at 250 °C, the MgH2–10 wt.% Ni0.6Zn0.4O sample could absorb 6.50 wt.% of H2 and desorbed 2.20 wt.% of H2 at 300 °C within 1 h. With the addition of 10 wt.% of Ni0.6Zn0.4O, the activation energy of MgH2 dropped from 133 kJ/mol to 97 kJ/mol. The morphology of the samples also demonstrated that the particle size is smaller compared with undoped samples. It is believed that in situ forms of NiO, ZnO, and MgO had good catalytic effects on MgH2, significantly reducing the activation energy and onset desorption temperature while improving the sorption kinetics of MgH2. © 2023 by the authors.","magnesium hydride; metal oxide; nickel zinc oxide; solid-state hydrogen storage","Activation energy; Desorption; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; II-VI semiconductors; Magnesia; Nickel oxide; Particle size; Desorption temperatures; Hydrogen sorption; Hydrogen storage capacities; Hydrogen storage materials; Metal-oxide; Nickel zinc oxide; Solid state method; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Sorption kinetics; Synthesised; Zinc oxide"

Due to its light weight and explosive nature, hydrogen need to be stored in safe and efficient way. The storage in solid state materials has been proposed as the safest method, which can store hydrogen through chemical bonding. Among several studied materials so far, KSiH3 is one of the leading contender with a total hydrogen capacity of 4.3 wt %, which is more than what is offered by its rivals such as BCC hydrides or AB5 type hydrides. However, the high activation energy slows down the hydrogen charging/discharging rate and allow the working only at higher temperatures (∼200 °C). The kinetics of hydrogen absorption and desorption intensely improved by the addition of a catalyst. In this work, vanadium based catalysts are added to KSiH3 system to modify the surface and to enhance the kinetics of this system. Specially, V2O5 addition, as leading candidate among the studied catalyst, decreased the activation energy to 83 kJmol-1 from 142 kJ/mol for pristine KSi. KSiH3 system with catalyst V2O5 started desorbing at 100 °C and could achieve highest weight loss 3.7 wt % which is very close to theoretical value. No disproportionation phenomenon is detected which indicated that the reaction between KSiH3 and KSi is flawlessly reversible with a hydrogen storage capacity of 3.7 wt % H2.

Here, a nanocomposite catalyst with interfacial coupling and oxygen defects, Ni/CeO2, is fabricated to promote H2 desorption and absorption properties of MgH2. The interface of Ni/CeO2 contributes to both strong mechanical coupling towards stabilizing partial Ni and electronic coupling towards inducing a high concentration of oxygen vacancies in CeO2. Theoretical calculations evidence that CeO2 with oxygen vacancy assist Ni in weakening the energy of Mg-H bond as well as enhancing the adsorption energy of Ni upon hydrogen atoms, and the extent of this assistance surprisingly increases with increasing oxygen vacancies concentration. As a result, an impressive performance is achieved by MgH2-5 wt.% Ni/CeO2 with onset desorption temperature of only 165 °C, and it absorbs approximately 80% hydrogen in just 800 s at 125 °C. The generation mechanism of intermediate active species concerning Ni/CeO2 in different states has been analyzed for the first time, and the relationship between interfacial coupling and phase evolution has been elucidated. Therefore, a mechanism of the catalysis-assisting effect regarding oxygen defects is proposed.

Organoamine boranes, methylamine borane (MeAB), and ethane 1,2 diamine borane (EDAB), known as ammonia borane (AB) carbon derivatives, are synthesized to be used as a solid-state hydrogen storage medium. Thermal dehydrogenation of MeAB and EDAB is performed at 80 °C, 100 °C, and 120 °C under different conditions (self, catalytic, and hydro-catalytic) for hydrogen production and compared with AB. For this purpose, a cobalt-doped activated carbon (Co-AC) catalyst is fabricated. The physicochemical properties of Co-AC catalyst is investigated by well-known techniques such as ATR/FT-IR, XRD, XPS, ICP-MS, BET, and TEM. The synthesized Co-AC catalyst obtained in nano CoOOH structure (20 nm, 12% Co wt) is formed and well-dispersed on the activated carbon support. It has indicated that Co-AC exhibits efficient catalytic activity towards organoamine boranes thermal dehydrogenation. Hydrogen release tests show that hydro-catalytic treatment improves the thermal dehydrogenation kinetics of neat MeAB, EDAB, and AB. Co-AC catalyzed hydro-treatment for thermal dehydrogenation of MeAB and EDAB acceleras the hydrogen release from 0.13 mL H2/min to 46.12 mL H2/min, from 0.16 mL H2/min to 38.06 mL H2/min, respectively at 80 °C. Moreover, hydro-catalytic treatment significantly lowers the H2 release barrier of organoamine boranes thermal dehydrogenation, from 110 kJ/mol to 19 kJ/mol for MeAB and 130 kJ/mol to 21 kJ/mol for EDAB.

However, the low inherent thermal conductivity of metal hydride powder significantly limits the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation process in the metal hydride bed. Accurate measurement and improvement of the effective thermal conductivity of a hydride bed is of great significance for design of solid-state hydrogen storage devices. This article analyzes the factors that influence the effective thermal conductivity of a metal hydride bed, and also introduces different measurement methods and improvement ways for the effective thermal conductivity of a metal hydride bed. It is an effective way to improve the thermal conductivity of metal hydride beds by hydride powder mixed with a high thermal conductivity material and compaction. Accurately measuring the influence of hydrogen pressure, temperature and hydrogen storage capacity and other factors on the effective thermal conductivity of a metal hydride bed and obtaining the numerical equation of effective thermal conductivity play an important role in guiding the optimization design of heat and mass transfer structure of metal hydride hydrogen storage devices. The transient plane source method seems to be a better measurement choice because of short test time and easy to establish a pressure-tight and temperature control test system.

The result shows the decrement of the initial decomposition temperature from the 4MgH2-LiAlH4-TiO2 composite when contrasted with the 4MgH2-LiAlH4 system. The initial dehydrogenation temperature of 4MgH2-LiAlH4-10 wt% TiO2 destabilized system decreased from 100°C and 270°C of undoped composite to 70°C and 200°C, respectively, for the desorption process in the first two stages.

For the development of a hydrogen energy economy, hydrogen storage technology must be improved to over the storage limitations. Compared with traditional hydrogen storage technology, the prospect of hydrogen storage materials is broader. Among all types of hydrogen storage materials, solid hydrogen storage materials are most promising and have the most safety security. Solid hydrogen storage materials include high surface area physical adsorption materials and interstitial and non-interstitial hydrides. Among them, interstitial hydrides, also called intermetallic hydrides, are hydrides formed by transition metals or their alloys. The main alloy types are A2B, AB, AB2, AB3, A2B7, AB5, and BCC. A is a hydride that easily forms metal (such as Ti, V, Zr, and Y), while B is a non-hydride forming metal (such as Cr, Mn, and Fe). The development of intermetallic compounds as hydrogen storage materials is very attractive because their volumetric capacity is much higher (80-160 kgH2m-3) than the gaseous storage method and the liquid storage method in a cryogenic tank (40 and 71 kgH2m-3). Additionally, for hydrogen absorption and desorption reactions, the environmental requirements are lower than that of physical adsorption materials (ultra-low temperature) and the simplicity of the procedure is higher than that of non-interstitial hydrogen storage materials (multiple steps and a complex catalyst). In addition, there are abundant raw materials and diverse ingredients. For the synthesis and optimization of intermetallic compounds, in addition to traditional melting methods, mechanical alloying is a very important synthesis method, which has a unique synthesis mechanism and advantages.

Sodium alanate (NaAlH4) with suitable thermodynamics and relatively high capacity was one of the most promising hydrogen storage materials for practical applications. However, high kinetic barriers induced high operating temperature, slow hydrogen release/uptake rate and poor reversibility. Considerable studies revealed that the addition of Ti-based catalysts could effectively improve its kinetic performance, consequently reducing the de-/hydrogenation temperature and enhancing the hydrogen storage reversibility. In this work, recent research progress of hydrogen storage properties of NaAlH4 modified by Ti-based catalysts was reviewed to guide the future development of this hydrogen storage system. First, the doping methods of Ti-based catalysts were introduced. After that, the improvement in hydrogen storage performance of NaAlH4 with various Ti-based catalysts was summarized and the corresponding catalytic mechanisms were elucidated. Finally, the future research direction of catalyst-modified NaAlH4 was discussed. It was well known that the addition process of catalysts was closely related to its existing state and distribution in metal hydride matrix, which affected the catalytic functions. High-energy ball milling treatment not only reduced the particle sizes of catalysts and NaAlH4 but also increased the uniform distribution of catalysts and intimate contact with NaAlH4 caused by energetic collision between milling balls. This facilitated the high catalytic activity. As a result, high-energy ball milling was the most frequently used and effective preparation strategy for catalyst-modified NaAlH4-based hydrogen storage materials. For optimizing catalysts, a variety of Ti-based compounds, including Ti-based organic compounds, halides, oxides and intermetallics, were studied and evaluated for their catalytic activity. Their effects on hydrogen storage behaviors of NaAlH4 were compared and the corresponding mechanisms were discussed and revealed. In particular, NaAlH4 catalyzed with ultrafine Ti nanoparticles supported on carbon displayed the best overall hydrogen storage properties. The usable hydrogen capacity remained at 5.07% and the on-set dehydrogenation temperature was reduced to 75℃. The dehydrogenated sample was fully hydrogenated within 3 min at 100℃ and 12.2 MPa of hydrogen pressure. More importantly, the capacity retention was as high as 98.6% after 100 cycles, which is quite favorable for practical applications. In addition, mechanistic studies revealed that high valent Ti-based compounds were reduced to low valent species and finally gave rise to the formation of Al-Ti or TiHx due to the strong reductivity of NaAlH4 during ball milling and initial dehydrogenation/hydrogenation cycling. The Al-Ti or TiHx species work as the actual active catalysts to promote the breaking and recombination of Al-H bonding. This was the most important reason for the reduced operating temperatures of dehydrogenation/hydrogenation. The key role played by Ti-based catalysts in the reduction of kinetic energy barriers for hydrogen release from NaAlH4 was further confirmed by theoretical calculations. The future studies should mainly focus on the synergistic effects of nanostructing and nano-catalysis to further improve the overall hydrogen storage properties of NaAlH4 materials. © Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Rare Metals.

The composite system LiBH4-MgH2 can reversibly store hydrogen with a gravimetric capacity of 13 wt%. However, its dehydrogenation/hydrogenation kinetics is extremely sluggish (∼40 h) which hinders its usage for commercial applications. In this work, the kinetics of this composite system is significantly enhanced (∼96%) by adding a small amount of NbF5. The catalytic effect of NbF5 on the dehydrogenation/hydrogenation process of LiBH4-MgH2 is systematically investigated using a broad range of experimental techniques such as in situ synchrotron radiation X-ray powder diffraction (in situ SR-XPD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), anomalous small angle X-ray scattering (ASAXS), and ultra/small-angle neutron scattering (USANS/SANS).

In solid-state hydrogen storage materials, especially NaAlH4, finding effective catalysts and using mechanical treatment represent promising solutions to overcome the drawbacks of NaAlH4. For the first time, in this work, the influence of spherical strontium titanate (SrTiO3) on the dehydrogenation behavior of NaAlH4 has been investigated. Here, we report that the onset desorption temperature is decreased and the desorption kinetics of NaAlH4 is enhanced with the addition of 10 wt% of spherical SrTiO3 catalyst. Using Kissinger's technique, the apparent activation energy of the NaAlH4 doped with 10 wt% SrTiO3 composites for the two-step dehydrogenation was identified as 79 and 92 kJ/mol, which was decreased significantly from that of undoped NaAlH4 (116 and 122 kJ/mol, respectively). Scanning electron microscopy results indicated that the NaAlH4 particle sizes decreased by milling with SrTiO3. X-ray diffraction results indicated that SrTiO3 did not react or change during the milling and desorption (heating) processes.

This work investigates the thermodynamic changes induced by the variation of Ti content along the homogeneity range of the TiFe phase (Ti:Fe ratio from 1:1–1:0.9) and of the substitution of Mn for Fe between 0 and 5 at%.

Moreover, it is demonstrated that Ti-rich alloys display enhanced storage capacities, as long as a limited amount of β-Ti is formed.

However, the applications of MgH2 were restricted due to the slow rate of hydrogen absorption and desorption, and the high working temperature. To date, in order to meet the requirements of solid hydrogen storage materials for vehicular hydrogen storage, many methods to improve the hydrogen storage performance of MgH2 were developed by scientific researchers such as alloying, nanocrystallization, and catalyst doping. These methods reduced the hydrogen desorption temperature of the system, increased the hydrogen absorption and desorption cycle stability. Among them, catalyst doping was the most extensively studied one, and it was considered to be a very effective way to improve the performance of magnesium-based hydrogen storage. A mechanical ball milling process was used to add the catalyst. During the ball milling process, the catalyst might react with the magnesium hydride in a solid state. Ball milling was a very important method of structural modification. It could not only conveniently control the composition of the alloy, but also could directly obtain materials with metastable structures such as nanocrystalline, amorphous and supersaturated solid solutions. In this method, metals (such as Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, etc.), metal compounds (such as Nb2O5, CeO2, TMTiO3 (TM=Ni, Co), etc.), transition metal halides (such as CeF4, CeF3, LaCl3, etc.), carbon-based materials (such as graphite, graphene, AC, CFs, etc.), metal-based and carbon-based composites were used as catalysts, and added single or in combination to magnesium-based alloys by mechanical ball milling. The research results showed that transition metals had a strong affinity for hydrogen atoms. During the dissociation of hydrogen molecules or the recombination of hydrogen atoms, the d electrons of transition metals and the electrons on the hydrogen atom/hydrogen molecular orbital were transferred and filled, which resulted in the interaction forces to promote the dissociation of hydrogen molecules and the recombination of hydrogen atoms. At the same time, after the metal catalyst was doped, many defects were generated on the surface of MgH2, which were conducive to charge and heat transfer. Furthermore, the metal oxides were cheap and easy to prepare. Doping transition metal oxides could effectively catalyze the hydrogen absorption and desorption reaction of MgH2. It could also be used as a lubricant and dispersant during the grinding process to prevent the agglomeration of MgH2 particles and refine the size of MgH2 particles, accelerate the hydrogen desorption kinetics of MgH2, catalyze the hydrogen absorption and desorption reaction of MgH2. Transition metal halides could react with MgH2 in the process of hydrogen absorption and desorption to generate transition metal hydrides. These transition metal hydrides could promote the dissociation of hydrogen molecules and the diffusion of hydrogen atoms, promote nucleation and reduction in the hydrogenation process. The reaction product of metal sulfide or metal hydride and MgH2 in the ball milling process had high catalytic activity, which could solve the problem of slow dehydrogenation/hydrogenation kinetics to a certain extent. In addition, MgS could provide abundant nucleation active sites, and Fe element could stabilize MgH2. LaF3 could react with Mg to form MgF2 and LaH3 phases during hydrogenation ball milling, which significantly increased the amount and rate of hydrogen desorption of magnesium. The catalytic mechanism was that LaH3 acted as a hydrogen pump. The addition of carbon-based materials could promote the nucleation of the Mg/MgH2 phase, refine the particle size, and improve the hydrogen absorption kinetics. Unfortunately, the effect was weaker than that of metal-based catalysts. Doped with metal-based and carbon-based composite catalysts, MgH2 could simultaneously obtain the effects of doped metal-based and carbon-based catalysts, such as the low dehydrogenation temperature, low dehydrogenation activation energy and excellent cycle stability. It could be seen that doped metal-based catalysts could generally promote the formation and decomposition of MgH2 bonds by generating a large number of defects or new phases, and then enhancing the dehydrogenation/hydrogenation kinetics of the hydrogen storage material system. Carbon-based materials doped with non-metals could effectively prevent MgH2 particles from agglomeration and grain growth during the ball milling process. In addition, its low density could maintain the high hydrogen storage capacity of MgH2 materials. In order to meet the practical standard, it was necessary to develop new technology and find new experimental methods. One of the important strategies to improve the hydrogen storage performance of MgH2 was synergistic utilization of metal-based materials and carbon-based materials as catalysts. To carry out composite catalysis research and to study the synergistic effect of different catalysts could help to improve the hydrogen storage performance of MgH2. With the help of simulation calculation or first principles, the mechanism of chemical reaction of MgH2 in the process of hydrogen absorption and desorption after catalyst doping could be further clarified. Therefore, the uniqueness and potential advantages of metal hydride hydrogen storage technology could be fully exploited. © Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Rare Metals.

Nanometer-sized MgD2 domains with the average crystallite size of ~10 nm embedded in a Cr matrix are formed in deuterated Mg0.25Cr0.75. X-ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies show that the MgD2 domains are heavily distorted, which leads to the thermodynamic destabilization lowering the reaction temperature.

The apparent activation energy for hydrogen desorption of Mg0.25Cr0.75−H is decreased to 75 kJ mol−1 from ~160 kJ mol−1 for bulk Mg, in which the dehydrogenation of nanometer-sized MgH2 is controlled by one-dimensional diffusion of hydrogen.

However, the extremely low volumetric density gives rise to the main challenge in hydrogen storage, and therefore, exploring effective storage techniques is key hurdles that need to be crossed to accomplish the sustainable hydrogen economy. Hydrogen physically or chemically stored into nanomaterials in the solid-state is a desirable prospect for effective large-scale hydrogen storage, which has exhibited great potentials for applications in both reversible onboard storage and regenerable off-board storage applications. Its attractive points include safe, compact, light, reversibility, and efficiently produce sufficient pure hydrogen fuel under the mild condition. This review comprehensively gathers the state-of-art solid-state hydrogen storage technologies using nanostructured materials, involving nanoporous carbon materials, metal-organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, porous aromatic frameworks, nanoporous organic polymers, and nanoscale hydrides.

Primary renewable energy such as solar, wind, and hydro are developed for energy production particularly for electricity generation. However, there are still some deficiencies in direct use of primary renewable energy sources; therefore, secondary energy sources (or carriers) have been recently established as clean energy sources. Hydrogen is a type of secondary energy sources with almost low density and light weight; therefore, it must be stored in the form of liquid or gas. The storage of hydrogen in the form of liquid requires very low temperature. Solid-state hydrogen storage on the surfaces of solids or within solids is a promising solution to above shortcomings for high-density energy storage. Herein, multi-layers solid-state materials with ability of hydrogen adsorption are presented, for the first time, including “mixed metal oxide (MMO) nanostructures” and “silicate layers”. The MMO is CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanostructures which synthesized via Pechini method in front of various chelating agents such as trimesic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, and malonic acid, while the silicate layer is nanoclay montmorillonite K10. In this study, the experimental observations reveal a pure formation of CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanostructures in malonic acid at 500 °C, with almost regular nanosized morphology of 20–25 nm. The selected sample is then used for nanocomposite formation by dispersing the CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanostructures into the montmorillonite K10 solution. The final nanocomposites exhibit a superior electrochemical hydrogen storage performance, in terms of “maximum discharge capacity of ∼ 3750 mAh/g)” and “efficiency of about 70%” in an alkaline medium. It must be mentioned that though the maximum discharge capacity of the CuCe2(MoO4)4 nanostructures is higher than nanocomposites (for example ∼ 6000 mAh/g), but the efficiency (discharge/charge) is lower (∼48%). It can be emphasized that this nanocomposite can be applied as promising host in an electrochemical hydrogen storage system, which can meet the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) hydrogen storage targets. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Discharge capacity; Hydrogen storage; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Pechini","Chelation; Clay minerals; Copper compounds; Electric discharges; Gas adsorption; Hydrogen storage; Metals; Nanocomposites; Nanostructures; Renewable energy resources; Self assembly; Temperature; Discharge capacities; Energy productions; Malonic acid; Mixed metal oxide; Montmorillonite K10; Pechini; Scale-up; Secondary energy sources; Silicate layers; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Fossil fuels"

Currently, most of our energy demands are fulfilled by fossil fuels. After 20 years, non-renewable fossil fuels are estimated to plummet rapidly. The world will face energy shortage and will seek for a new environmental method of energy generation for transportation, economy and application. Hydrogen is a fascinating energy carrier that is considered as ‘hydrogen economy’ for the future. The key challenge in developing the hydrogen economy is the context of hydrogen storage. Storing hydrogen via the solid-state method has received special attention and consideration because of its safety and larger storage capacity. A light complex hydride, NaAlH4, is considered as an attractive material for solid-state hydrogen storage owing to its high hydrogen capacity, bulk in availability and low cost. Sluggish sorption kinetics and poor reversibility have driven research into various catalysts to enhance its hydrogen storage properties. This review article examines the development of different catalysts and their effects on the hydrogen storage properties of NaAlH4. The addition of catalyst offers synergistic catalytic effect on the dehydrogenation performance of NaAlH4. Doping NaAlH4 with catalyst promote promising results such as lower decomposition temperature, improved kinetics and reduced activation energy. Superior performance on the dehydrogenation performance of NaAlH4 doping with the catalyst may be due to the nanosized catalyst particle and in situ formed active species that may serve as nucleation sites at the surface of the NaAlH4 matrix and benefiting the kinetics properties of NaAlH4. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Catalysts; Hydrogen storage; NaAlH<sub>4</sub>; Solid-state storage","Activation energy; Aluminum compounds; Dehydrogenation; Fossil fuels; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen fuels; Kinetics; Nanocatalysts; Sodium compounds; Decomposition temperature; Energy generations; Hydrogen capacities; Hydrogen storage properties; Nanosized catalysts; Solid state method; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Sorption kinetics; Hydrogen storage"

NH4Cl is a cheap chemical which has mature synthesis technologies in large industrial productions. The protonic H (Hδ+) in NH4Cl and the hydridic H (Hδ−) in MgH2 have coulomb interaction which allow MgH2 to release hydrogen at milder temperatures. In this article, by designing the molar ratio of MgH2 and NH4Cl as 2:1 (equal molar ratio of Hδ+ and Hδ−), the hydrogen release peak temperature can be decreased to 164.8 °C, and the ammonia generation is remarkably suppressed. In particular, graphene introduction to the 2MgH2+NH4Cl composite can further reduce the hydrogen release temperature to 161.2 °C and improve the hydrogen purity up to 97.26%. It is revealed that the smaller particle size and the better dispersion of 2MgH2+NH4Cl/graphene composite allows better interaction between Hδ+ and Hδ−, which brings down the hydrogen desorption temperature and improves the hydrogen purity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Composite; Graphene; Hydrogen desorption; Mg-based alloys","Ammonia; Chlorine compounds; Desorption; Fuel cells; Hydrogen storage; Molar ratio; Particle size; Hydrogen desorption; Hydrogen desorption temperatures; Hydrogen release; Industrial production; Low temperatures; Peak temperatures; Practical use; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Magnesium compounds"

LiAlH4, as a solid-state hydrogen storage material, presents several advantages such as high hydrogen storage capacity, low price and abundant sources. Unfortunately, neither thermodynamic nor kinetic properties of dehydrogenation for LiAlH4 can fulfill the requirements of practical application. Thus, a series of spinel ferrite nanoparticles such as XFe2O4 (X = Ni, Co, Mn, Cu, Zn, Fe) were prepared by using the modified thermal decomposition method, and then doped into LiAlH4 by using ball milling. Our results show that LiAlH4 doped with 7 wt% NiFe2O4 starts to release hydrogen at 69.1 °C, and the total amount of hydrogen released is 7.29 wt% before 300 °C. The activation energies of the two-step hydrogen release reactions of LiAlH4 doped with 7 wt% NiFe2O4 are 42.32 kJ mol−1 and 71.42 kJ mol−1, which are 59.0% and 63.6% lower than those of as-received LiAlH4, respectively. Combining the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we reveal that both the presence of NiFe2O4 and in-situ formed Al4Ni3 in ball-milling decrease the desorption energy barrier of Al-H bonding in LiAlH4 and accelerate the breakdown of Al-H bonding through the interfacial charge transfer and the dehybridization of the Al-H cluster. Thus, the experimental and theoretical results open a new avenue toward designing high effective catalysts applied to LiAlH4 as a candidate for hydrogen storage. © 2021","Hydrogen storage; Lithium aluminum; Spinel ferrite nanoparticles","Activation energy; Aluminum; Aluminum compounds; Ball milling; Binary alloys; Charge transfer; Cost effectiveness; Decomposition; Dehydrogenation; Density functional theory; Ferrite; Lithium; Milling (machining); Nanoparticles; Cost effective; Dehydrogenation properties; H-bonding; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen storage materials; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Spinel ferrites; Spinel-ferrite nanoparticles; Theoretical study; Zn nanoparticles; Hydrogen storage"

In this work, two types of calorimetric techniques were applied to measure the thermodynamic properties of magnesium-rich alloys from the Mg-Pd system (containing 97.7; 85.4; 80.6; 79.9; 72.3; 70.7; 64.5 at% of Mg respectively).

The combustion of hydrogen releases energy in the form of heat. When hydrogen reacts with oxygen in a fuel cell, the reaction releases energy in the form of electricity. Unlike hydrocarbon-based fuels, the generation of energy from either the combustion of hydrogen or the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell is not accompanied by the emission of greenhouse gases. This makes hydrogen a promising solution to solve global warming issues. However, hydrogen has a low volumetric density (low energy density per unit volume) which makes storing or transporting hydrogen extremely difficult and expensive. To accelerate the utilization of hydrogen as an energy carrier, it is necessary to develop advanced hydrogen storage methods that have the potential to have a higher energy density. The hydrogen storage market is segmented by application into: (1) Stationary power: stored hydrogen is consumed for example in a fuel cell for use in backup power stations, refueling stations, power stations; (2) Portable power: hydrogen storage applications for electronic devices such as mobile phones, flash lights, and portable generators; and (3) Transportation: industries including automobiles, aerospace, unmanned aerial systems, and hydrogen tanks used throughout the hydrogen supply chain. The increasing development of light and heavy fuel cell vehicles is expected to drive the development of on-board solid-state hydrogen technologies.

However, to date, no material has been found that satisfies all the desired properties to be viably used in many applications. Even if we consider only three parameters namely gravimetric density, volumetric density, and system cost, no materials that can meet the ultimate targets of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) or the 2030 targets of the European Union's Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU) and the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) in Japan.

The current study presents a systematic approach for solving the activation issue (difficulty in the first hydrogenation), one of the major obstacles to the practical application of TiFe alloys, via the use of a secondary AB2 phase. Based on the Ti–Fe–Cr ternary phase diagram, Ti–Fe–Cr alloys containing 80 at% Ti(Fe,Cr) (AB phase) and 20 at% Ti(Fe,Cr)2 (AB2 phase) were designed; the Cr concentrations in the AB and AB2 phase were systematically varied while maintaining fixed phase fractions. Activation at RT was achieved when the overall Cr concentration was higher than 9.7 at%. Analysis of the activation characteristics of the individual phases revealed that the AB2 phase readily absorbed hydrogen, thereby initiating activation of AB + AB2 alloys. Notably, higher Cr concentrations enable the AB phase to absorb hydrogen at RT during the activation process, although the kinetics are much slower than that of the co-existing AB2 phase. The equilibrium hydrogen pressures from the pressure-composition isotherms decrease as the Cr concentration increases, indicating that Cr stabilizes hydrides. Increased hydride stability may also promote the kinetics of the initial hydride formation in both the AB and AB2 phases. An optimal composition for Ti–Fe–Cr alloys can be designed given the conditions of easy activation at RT and maximum reversible capacity within an operating pressure range. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Activation; Hydrogen storage; Laves phase; TiFe alloy","Activation analysis; Binary alloys; Chemical activation; Chromium compounds; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogen storage alloys; Iron alloys; Titanium alloys; Activation characteristics; Activation process; Hydride stabilities; Optimal composition; Pressure composition isotherms; Reversible capacity; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Ternary phase diagrams; Chromium alloys"

As for the technical perspective, carriers to be used for solid-state hydrogen storage for various applications can be classified into two classes: metal and complex hydrides. Related crystal structures and corresponding hydrogen sorption properties are reviewed and discussed. Fundamentals of thermodynamics of hydrogen sorption evidence the key role of the enthalpy of reaction, which determines the operating conditions (i.e., temperatures and pressures). In addition, it rules the heat to be removed from the tank during hydrogen absorption and to be delivered to the tank during hydrogen desorption. Suitable values for the enthalpy of hydrogen sorption reaction for operating conditions close to ambient (i.e., room temperature and 1–10 bar of hydrogen) are close to 30 kJ·molH2−1 . The kinetics of the hydrogen sorption reaction is strongly related to the microstructure and to the morphology (i.e., loose powder or pellets) of the carriers. Usually, the kinetics of the hydrogen sorption reaction is rather fast, and the thermal management of the tank is the rate-determining step of the processes. As for the social perspective, the paper arguments that, as it occurs with the exploitation of other renewable innovative technologies, a wide consideration of the social factors connected to these processes is needed to reach a twofold objective: To assess the extent to which a specific innovation might produce positive or negative impacts in the recipient socioeconomic system and, from a sociotechnical perspective, to explore the potential role of the social components and dynamics in fostering the diffusion of the innovation itself. Within the social domain, attention has been paid to address the underexplored relationship between the gender perspective and the enhancement of hydrogen-related energy storage systems.

A great advancement of the onset dehydrogenation temperature and de/rehydrogenation kinetics of 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 composite was achieved by doping Al2TiO5 to the composite. For the first and second desorption stages, the 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 + 5 wt% Al2TiO5 composite began to liberate hydrogen at 85 °C and 230 °C. In comparison, the undoped system commenced to liberate hydrogen at 120 °C and 270 °C, which were 35 °C and 10 °C lower, respectively when contrasted with the undoped composite. For the rehydrogenation kinetics, about 1.9 wt% hydrogen was absorbed within 5 min for the 5 wt% Al2TiO5-doped 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 system, whereas the neat sample only absorbed about 1.2 wt% hydrogen under similar conditions. As for the dehydrogenation kinetics, 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 + 5 wt% Al2TiO5 composite desorbed 1.7 wt% hydrogen within 10 min of desorption, while the 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 system released 0.8 wt% hydrogen in the same time frame. The apparent activation energy for the MgH2-relevant decomposition decreased from 121 kJ/mol (4MgH2 + LiAlH4 system) to 102 kJ/mol, after 5 wt% Al2TiO5 was introduced into the destabilized system. The decline in particle size also enhance the hydrogen storage behaviors. The synergistic effect of Al2TiO5 on the hydrogen storage behavior of 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 sample is attributed to the formation of new species of TiH2, AlTi2 and LiTi2O4 after ball milling and heating process, which acted as a real catalyser in the 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 + 5 wt% Al2TiO5 destabilized system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Alanate; Catalytic effects; Destabilized system; Hydrogen storage materials; Magnesium hydride; Solid-state hydrogen storage","Activation energy; Ball milling; Dehydrogenation; Desorption; Hydrogen storage; Kinetics; Lithium compounds; Milling (machining); Particle size; Ternary alloys; Alanates; Ball milling process; Catalytic effects; Destabilized system; Hydrogen storage behaviors; Hydrogen storage materials; Magnesium hydride; Rehydrogenation; Solid-state hydrogen storage; TiO; Magnesium compounds"

However, storing H2 under safe and operable conditions is still a challenging process due to the current commercial method, i.e., H2 storage in a pressurised and liquified state, which requires extremely high pressure and extremely low temperature. To solve this problem, research on solid-state H2 storage materials is being actively conducted. Among the solid-state H2 storage materials, borohydride is a potential candidate for H2 storage owing to its high gravimetric capacity (majority borohydride materials release >10 wt% of H2 ). Mg(BH4 )2, which is included in the borohydride family, shows promise as a good H2 storage material owing to its high gravimetric capacity (14.9 wt%). However, its practical application is hindered by high thermal decomposition temperature (above 300◦ C), slow sorption kinetics and poor reversibility. Currently, the general research on the use of additives to enhance the H2 storage performance of Mg(BH4 )2 is still under investigation. This article reviews the latest research on additive-enhanced Mg(BH4 )2 and its impact on the H2 storage performance. The future prospect and challenges in the development of additive-enhanced Mg(BH4 )2 are also discussed in this review paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review paper that focuses on the additive-enhanced Mg(BH4 )2 for solid-state H2 storage. © 2022 by the authors.

Herein, V4Nb18O55 microspheres composed of nanoparticles with size of tens of nanometers are fabricated to promote H2 desorption and absorption properties of MgH2, which results in the uniform formation of Nb/V interfaces based on a molecular scale during the reversible hydrogen storage process. It is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated that the uniform building of Nb/V interfaces not only preserves the ability of Nb in weakening Mg-H bonds but also alleviates the strong adsorption capacity of metallic Nb toward hydrogen atoms, leading to a relative energy barrier for the whole dehydrogenation process of MgH2 of only 0.5 eV, which is 0.22 and 0.43 eV lower than that of Nb and V, respectively. As a result, under the addition of V4Nb18O55 microspheres, the onset H2 desorption temperature of MgH2 is decreased to 165 °C, 125 °C lower than that of bulk MgH2, and the complete hydrogenation of Mg could be realized even at room temperature, while almost no H2 adsorption is observed for bulk Mg at a high temperature of 50 °C. © 2022 The Authors.

Molecular hydrogen is the most-favored chemical fuel alternative for both stationary and mobile applications. Hydrogen is the most efficient energy carrier known to us with the highest heating value per mass, i.e., 120–142 MJ/kg of all chemical fuels. Hydrogen also has the highest gross calorific value being 141.7 MJ/kg significantly higher than petrol 46.4 MJ/kg and diesel 45.6 MJ/kg for 0 °C at 1 bar. The production of hydrogen gas is a challenge itself. Water being the only by-product of the energy generation and zero emissions, hydrogen is regenerative and eco friendly. Gravimetric density and volumetric density are crucial for stationary and mobile applications. In this paper, the storage methods reviewed were high-pressure cylinder (upto 800 bars) using different metals and lightweight composite materials, storage of hydrogen in a liquid state using cryogenic tanks at 21 K, storage of hydrogen using the metal–organic framework and solid materials, chemical storage using covalent and ionic compounds, storage using selective few metals which possess property to absorb hydrogen excessively in large amount, storage that uses nanostructured based metal hydrides and absorption of hydrogen using carbon-based materials like Graphene.

Bimetallic amidoboranes are expected to introduce novel and enhanced physicochemical properties regarding storage and stability. However, these materials are still scarce and mostly grouped around magnesium- or aluminum-containing compounds. We present here a rapid and green mechanochemical solvent-free synthesis of two novel calcium-containing bimetallic amidoboranes, Li2Ca(NH2BH3)4 and Na2Ca(NH2BH3)4, from metal hydrides and ammonia borane. The insight into mechanochemical syntheses is provided by the in situ tandem synchrotron X-ray diffraction and thermal monitoring.

In situ monitoring of thermal dehydrogenation of these materials is conducted by mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy, showing how the course of thermal decomposition varies depending on the structure of the amidoborane, resulting however in the same final products. These new hydrogen-rich bimetallic amidoboranes are structurally characterized by high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction, and they both show potential for hydrogen storage applications: high theoretical gravimetric capacities and low desorption temperatures of hydrogen without the significant presence of harmful gases.

Nevertheless, slow desorption/absorption kinetics and high thermodynamic stability are two issues that have constrained the commercialization of MgH2 as a solid-state hydrogen storage material. So, to boost the desorption/absorption kinetics and to alter the thermodynamics of MgH2, hafnium tetrachloride (HfCl4) was used as a catalyst in this study. Different percentages of HfCl4 (5, 10, 15 and 20 wt%) were added to MgH2 and their catalytic influences on the hydrogen storage properties of MgH2 were investigated. Results showed that the 15 wt% HfCl4-doped MgH2 sample was the best composite to enhance the hydrogen storage performance of MgH2. The onset decomposition temperature of the 15 wt% HfCl4-doped MgH2 composite was decreased by ~75 °C compared to as-milled MgH2. Meanwhile, the desorption/absorption kinetic measurements showed an improvement compared to the undoped MgH2. From the Kissinger analysis, the apparent dehydrogenation activation energy was 167.0 kJ/mol for undoped MgH2 and 102.0 kJ/mol for 15 wt% HfCl4-doped MgH2. This shows that the HfCl4 addition reduced the activation energy of the hydrogen decomposition of MgH2. The desorption enthalpy change calculated by the van't Hoff equation showed that the addition of HfCl4 to MgH2 did not affect the thermodynamic properties. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the size of the MgH2 particles decreased and there was less agglomeration after the addition of HfCl4. It is believed that the decrease in the particle size and in-situ generated MgCl2 and Hf-containing species had synergistic catalytic effects on enhancing the hydrogen storage properties of the HfCl4-doped MgH2 composite. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Catalyst; Hafnium tetrachloride; Magnesium hydride; Solid-state hydrogen storage","Activation analysis; Activation energy; Chlorine compounds; Desorption; Hafnium compounds; Hydrogen storage; Kinetics; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermodynamics; Candidate materials; Desorption enthalpy; Hafnium tetrachloride; Hydrogen storage capacities; Hydrogen storage properties; Onset decomposition temperatures; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Storage performance; Magnesium compounds"

The most viable clean, green and alternative energy carrier is hydrogen that can meet out the challenges posed towards energy scarcity. So, the present work focus on the effective storing of hydrogen on non-carboneous (Ah-BN) and hydrogen rich metal hydride (NaBH4) based storage medium. where a facile chemical impregnated method was adopted for the preparation of NaBH4/Ah-BN nanocomposite. The structural, morphological, elemental composition and specific surface area analysis of the prepared NaBH4/Ah-BN nanocomposite confirms the presence of NaBH4 wrapped around Ah-BN and enhanced specific surface area of 154.4 m2 g −1 (NaBH4/Ah-BN) from 68.2 m2 g −1 (Ah-BN). The presence of NaBH4 not only increases the specific surface area but also increases the pore volume thereby creating more defects. In contrast the presence of Ah-BN drastically reduces the decomposition temperature of NaBH4. The amount of stored hydrogen (Sievert's-like hydrogenation setup) was 3.8 wt% at 119 °C and the binding energy falls in the recommended range (0.33 −0.50 eV) of US-Department of Energy (DOE) 2025 targets. All the thermal analysis [thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)] ensures the two-step dehydrogenation for NaBH4/Ah-BN. Moreover, the utilization of NaBH4/Ah-BN as an electrode to store hydrogen electrochemically reveals the attainment of 2550 mAh/g discharge capacity during 15 cycles that equals to 4.10 wt% hydrogen storage capacity. Hence, these excellent characteristics proved that the prepared NaBH4/Ah-BN nanocomposite may serve as an excellent weakly chemisorbed hydrogen storage system and electrode material to store hydrogen electrochemically in the realm of Hydrogen Fuel cells. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Activated hexagonal boron nitride (Ah-BN); Electrochemical hydrogen storage; Hydrogen storage capacity; Reusability; Sodium borohydride (NaBH<sub>4</sub>)","Binding energy; Differential scanning calorimetry; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Global warming; Gravimetric analysis; Hydrides; Nanocomposites; Sodium Borohydride; Specific surface area; Temperature programmed desorption; Thermoanalysis; Thermogravimetric analysis; Alternative energy source; Decomposition temperature; Global warming and climate changes; Hydrogen storage capacities; Hydrogen storage medium; Hydrogen storage system; Solid-state hydrogen storage; US Department of Energy; Hydrogen storage"

Consequently, the hydrogen diffusion paths on the surfaces are also studied. The most unstable surface, MgH2(001), has the most drastic change in vacancy formation energy. The relative high barriers for vacancy H formation, especially on the most stable surface, MgH2(110), reflect the slow kinetics of H release. The introduction of vacancy into MgH2 surfaces often induces defect levels in the energy-gap region.

With an optimized TiO content of 0.06 in molar fraction, the LiBH4-0.06TiO system shows onset and peak dehydrogenation temperatures of 240 °C and 340 °C, respectively, which are 140 °C and 90 °C lower than those of the pure LiBH4. The LiBH4-0.06TiO system can rapidly release 9 wt% H2 after dwelling at 400 °C for 10 min. The hydrogenation of the dehydrogenation product initiates at 150 °C, and a capacity of 9 wt% is reached after isothermal dwelling at 500 °C under 50 bar of H2 for 100 min. The capacity retention of the system can reach 74.4% after 10 cycles, indicating a favorable reversibility. With the introduction of TiO, the apparent dehydrogenation activation energy of the system is evidently reduced, and the formation of Li2B12H12, a highly thermal stable intermediate phase, is greatly suppressed. In addition, the aggregation is evidently alleviated. All of these contribute to the enhanced dehydrogenation kinetics and reversibility.

Using the high-capacity hydrogen storage candidate LiAlH4 as an exemplar, we demonstrate an alternative approach to the thermodynamic stabilization of metastable metal hydrides by coordination to nitrogen binding sites within the nanopores of N-doped CMK-3 carbon (NCMK-3). The resulting LiAlH4@NCMK-3 material releases H2 at temperatures as low as 126 °C with full decomposition below 240 °C, bypassing the usual Li3AlH6 intermediate observed in bulk. Moreover, >80% of LiAlH4 can be regenerated under 100 MPa H2, a feat previously thought to be impossible. Nitrogen sites are critical to these improvements, as no reversibility is observed with undoped CMK-3. Density functional theory predicts a drastically reduced Al-H bond dissociation energy and supports the observed change in the reaction pathway. The calculations also provide a rationale for the solid-state reversibility, which derives from the combined effects of nanoconfinement, Li adatom formation, and charge redistribution between the metal hydride and the host.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.

Mg(HB)2 was obtained by an alternative synthesis route, which is the reaction between HB and di-n-butylmagnesium in THF. The dehydrogenation properties of this compound were evaluated by two different approaches: an “open” system by thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry, and in a closed system, by heating the compound under isothermal conditions. Different results were obtained depending on the approach. Unlike other boron- and nitrogen-based compounds, it is likely that when Mg(HB)2 is heated in a closed system, the dehydrogenation is limited and it occurs mainly due to the homopolar interaction between the protic hydrogen atoms of the molecule. Also, Mg(HB)2 presents a contrasting thermal behavior in comparison with previous HB derivatives. In addition, a characterization by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed, and we detected instability of Mg(HB)2 when it was irradiated with the X-ray beam.

The storage solutions for hydrogen required high-capacity storage technologies, which preferably operate at low pressures and have good performances in the kinetics of absorption/desorption. Metal hydrides such as magnesium hydride (MgH2) are promising candidates for such storage solutions, but several drawbacks including high onset desorption temperature (>400°C) and slow sorption kinetics need to be overcome. In this study, we reviewed the recent developments in the hydrogen storage performance development of MgH2 and found that the destabilization concept has been extensively explored. Lithium alanate or LiAlH4 has been used as a destabilizing agent in MgH2–LiAlH4 (Mg–Li–Al) due to its high capacity of hydrogen, which is 10.5 wt.%, and low onset desorption temperature (∼150°C). In this article, a review of the recent advances in the Mg–Li–Al system for the solid-state hydrogen storage material is studied. We discussed the effect of the ratio of MgH2 and LiAlH4, milling time, and additives in the Mg–Li–Al system. After the destabilization concept was introduced, the onset of the desorption temperature and activation energy of MgH2 were reduced, and the sorption properties improved. Further study showed that the intermetallic alloys of Li0.92Mg4.08 and Mg17Al12 that were formed in situ during the dehydrogenation process provide synergetic thermodynamic and kinetic destabilization in the Mg-Li-Al composite system. De/rehydrogenation measurements indicate that the intermetallic alloys of Li0.92Mg4.08 and Mg17Al12 were fully reversibly absorbed and desorbed hydrogen. Next, the remaining challenges and a possible development strategy of the Mg–Li–Al system are analyzed. This review is the first systematic study that focuses on the recent advances in the Mg–Li–Al system for storage solutions for hydrogen in solid-state materials.

In this study, Mg90Al10 was prepared by hydriding combustion synthesis (HCS), and then various Ti-based compounds (Ti, TiH2, TiO2 and TiF3) were introduced into Mg90Al10 by ball milling. Mg90Al10 + 10 wt% TiF3 displays the most excellent dehydrogenation property compared with those doped with other Ti-based compounds. For instance, due to the addition of 10 wt% TiF3, the peak dehydrogenation temperature and the apparent dehydrogenation activation energy of the composite are 86 °C and 77.1 kJ/mol lower than those of Mg90Al10 (364 °C and 155.95 kJ/mol). In addition, the catalytic effect of TiF3 on the hydrogen storage properties of Mg90Al10 has been investigated in detail. Except for the unreacted TiF3, Al3Ti and MgF2 can be found during the first dehydrogenation process and remain stable in the subsequent de/hydrogenation cycles, which can act as the active sites to accelerate the hydrogen dissociation and recombination. Therefore, the excellent hydrogen storage properties of Mg90Al10 + 10 wt% TiF3 can be attributed to the catalytic effect of TiF3, in-situ formed Al3Ti and MgF2.

Here, we report on a facile one-pot synthesis of a novel three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and expanded graphite (EG) nanocomposite (NC) decorated with Pd nanoparticles (NPs) as hydrogen storage media. The effects of the electrochemically active surface area and surface oxygen groups of the as-synthesized Pd/rGO-EG on electrochemical hydrogen uptake and release were investigated in detail. For comparison, five Pd/rGO-EG NCs with rGO/EG mass ratios of 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 were prepared. All the Pd/rGO-EG NCs exhibited a much higher hydrogen storage capacity than Pd/rGO and Pd/EG. Among them, Pd/rGO-EG(1:1) showed the highest hydrogen uptake and release (9850 mC cm-2 mg-1), which was over six- and twofold increase compared to Pd/rGO (1480 mC cm-2 mg-1) and Pd/EG (4290 mC cm-2 mg-1), respectively. The synergistic effects of the rGO-EG NC could be attributed to the formation of the 3D graphene-based structure, a minimal degree of sheet stacking, and homogeneous Pd NP dispersion. The formed Pd/rGO-EG NC possessed significant interfacial active sites, thereby greatly enhancing its performance for hydrogen uptake and release. The influence of the applied electrode potential on the formation of α-phase and β-phase nucleation in the as-synthesized materials was further investigated.

However, its sluggish dehydrogenation kinetics are still the bottleneck that restricts practical applications. To address this challenge, very recent pioneering experiments found that MgH2/single-atom catalyst (MgH2/SAC) heterojunctions can be promising candidates for hydrogen storage. However, the reaction mechanism and design guideline were still not well understood. Herein, we design and analyze MgH2/SAC heterojunction systems including nine 3d transition metals, using spin-polarized density functional theory calculations with van der Waals corrections. We found that the energy barriers of MgH2 dehydrogenation are significantly reduced by 0.51-2.22 eV through the promotion effects of a heterojunction. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, these promotion effects were analyzed in depth based on the observation of hydrogen diffusion behaviors. To provide further insights, the electron localization function, charge density difference, hydrogen adsorption energy, system electronegativity, d-band center, and crystal orbital Hamilton population were comprehensively analyzed to understand the origin of the high performance of MgH2/SACs. In particular, we found that the system electronegativity of SACs can act as an effective descriptor that predicts the dehydrogenation energy barriers. Most importantly, this study provides important design guidelines of a brand-new type of MgH2/SAC material and a promising solution to the sluggish kinetics of MgH2 dehydrogenation in hydrogen storage. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Calculations; Chemical bonds; Dehydrogenation; Density functional theory; Design; Electronegativity; Energy barriers; Gas adsorption; Heterojunctions; Hydrogen storage; Molecular dynamics; Reaction kinetics; Transition metals; Van der Waals forces; Dehydrogenation kinetics; Design and analysis; Environmental friendliness; Hydrogen storage materials; Mass densities; Promotion effects; Reaction mechanism; Single-atoms; Solid-state hydrogen storage; ]+ catalyst; Magnesium compounds"

The findings show that there is a mutual destabilization between the hydrides where the newly combined system has superior hydrogen storage performances as opposed to the unary components (LiAlH4 and Mg[BH4]2). Analysis on the initial decomposition temperature and isothermal de/hydrogenation kinetics has proven that the 2LiAlH4 + Mg(BH4)2 system possesses better performance. In an endeavor to ameliorate the performances of the hydrogen storage of 2LiAlH4 + Mg(BH4)2, the destabilized system was doped with TiF3. Three major steps of desorption were detected during the heating process in the 2LiAlH4 + Mg(BH4)2 system with and without the addition of TiF3, which are correlated to the decomposition of Mg(AlH4)2, MgH2 and LiBH4. It is found that 2LiAlH4 + Mg(BH4)2 + 5 wt.% TiF3 has decreased the initial decomposition temperature at about 60°C, which is 55°C lower than the non-catalyzed 2LiAlH4 + Mg(BH4)2 system. The isothermal absorption/desorption kinetics of the 2LiAlH4 + Mg(BH4)2 system have also been enhanced by the addition of TiF3. The activation energy for Mg(AlH4)2-, MgH2-, and LiBH4-relevant decomposition after doped 2LiAlH4 + Mg(BH4)2 with TiF3 are reduced to 36.5, 23.3, and 17.6 kJ mol−1. Studies on the structural characteristics analysis of the 2LiAlH4 + Mg(BH4)2 + TiF3 sample hint to the fact that the formation of the MgF2, LiF, TiH2 and Ti-Al species, during desorption, is the main responsible factor for the observed thermodynamics change of the reactions by modifying the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation pathway.

At present, most of review work focuses on the improvement of material performance, especially the catalysts design. This part is important, but the others, such as operation modes, are also vital to to make full use of material potential in the practical applications. Different operation modes of hydrolysis reaction have an impact on hydrogen capacity to various degrees. For example, hydrolysis in solution would decrease the hydrogen capacity of hydrogen generator to a low value due to the excessive water participating in the reaction. Therefore, application-oriented operation modes could become a key problem for hydrolysis reaction of LSHS materials.

In contrast, the reactor with three spiral tubes accomplished an exemplary reaction rate at a reasonable gravimetric density. This spiral arrangement became the base for developing a novel reactor that integrated heat pipes to reduce the sorption time.

Nevertheless, a high desorption temperature, slow desorption kinetic, and irreversibility have restricted the application of LiAlH4 as a solid-state hydrogen storage material. Hence, to lower the decomposition temperature and to boost the dehydrogenation kinetic, in this study, we applied K2NiF6 as an additive to LiAlH4. The addition of K2NiF6 showed an excellent improvement of the LiAlH4 dehydrogenation properties. After adding 10 wt% K2NiF6, the initial decomposition temperature of LiAlH4 within the first two dehydrogenation steps was lowered to 90 °C and 156 °C, respectively, that is 50 °C and 27 °C lower than that of the аs-milled LiAlH4. In terms of dehydrogenation kinetics, the dehydrogenation rate of K2NiF6-doped LiAlH4 sample was significantly higher as compared to аs-milled LiAlH4. The K2NiF6-doped LiAlH4 sample can release 3.07 wt% hydrogen within 90 min, while the milled LiAlH4 merely release 0.19 wt% hydrogen during the same period. According to the Arrhenius plot, the apparent activation energies for the desorption process of K2NiF6-doped LiAlH4 are 75.0 kJ/mol for the first stage and 88.0 kJ/mol for the second stage. These activation energies are lower compared to the undoped LiAlH4. The morphology study showed that the LiAlH4 particles become smaller and less agglomerated when K2NiF6 is added. The in situ formation of new phases of AlNi and LiF during the dehydrogenation process, as well as a reduction in particle size, is believed to be essential contributors in improving the LiAlH4 dehydrogenation characteristics. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Additive; Desorption temperature; Hydrogen storage; Lithium alanate","Activation energy; Additives; Arrhenius plots; Binary alloys; Dehydrogenation; Desorption; Diffusion; Hydrogen storage; Kinetics; Lithium; Particle size; Potassium compounds; Decomposition temperature; Dehydrogenation kinetics; Dehydrogenation properties; Desorption kinetics; Desorption temperatures; Hydrogen contents; Hydrogen storage materials; Lithium alanate; Slow desorption; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Lithium compounds"

The microstructure, phase composition and hydrogen storage properties of the medium entropy alloys were systematically studied. Microstructural analysis showed that nanoscale crystals were found in as-cast medium entropy alloys obtained by arc melting followed by natural cooling inside the furnace.

The alloys exhibit very excellent hydrogen absorption kinetic properties than reported alloys takes at least about 300 s. This is due to the fact that the present alloys are composed of nanocrystals with numerous interfaces and grain boundaries, and these defects can act as good channels for the diffusion of hydrogen atoms.

Herein, we review and summarize the recent advances of hydrides as negative electrodes for Ni-MH and A-ion batteries (A = Li, Na), and as electrolyte for all solid-state batteries (ASSB). Metallic hydrides such as intergrowth compounds are highlighted as the best compromise up to now for Ni-MH. Regarding anodes of Li-ion batteries, MgH2, especially its combination with TiH2, provides very promising results. Complex hydrides such as Li-borohydride and related closo-borates and monovalent carborate boron clusters appear to be very attractive as solid electrolytes for Li-based ASSB, whereas closo-hydroborate sodium salts and closo-carboborates are investigated for Na- and Mg-ASSB. Finally, further research directions are foreseen for hydrides in electrochemical applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Hydrides; Negative electrode; Ni-MH or A-ion batteries (A = Li, Na, Mg); Solid electrolyte","Anodes; Electrochemical electrodes; Hydrogen storage; Ions; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Magnesium compounds; Nickel compounds; Salts; Sodium compounds; Solid electrolytes; Solid-State Batteries; Anode material; Electrochemical applications; Electrochemicals; Ion batteries; Metallic hydrides; Negative electrode; Ni-MH or A-ion battery (A = li, na, mg); Nickel/metal hydride battery; Nickel/metal-hydride batteries; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Hydrides"

The starting cast ingots are mechanically chipped to flakes of about 400 μm, all displaying composite structures characterized by a typical eutectic microstructure with rather coarse features (1–5 μm). The flakes are cycled 1000 times at 330 °C under 30/1 bar H2 for the absorption/desorption processes. The hydrogen storage capacity is maintained throughout the cycling: 5.09, 4.46 and 3.49 wt% H2 for Ni16.3, Ni11.3 and Ni4.4 (at%), respectively. No significant microstructural change is observed, indicating the excellent stability of the alloys at elevated temperatures. Nevertheless, a marked porosity, and spheroidal Mg2Ni clusters can be noted after cycling, however their exact contribution to reaction kinetics has yet to be fully elucidated. An attempt is made to estimate the dehydrogenation activation energy of Ni16.3, and the calculated value seems comparable to that obtained for an early cycling stage (10 cycles). In the light of the superior stability under cyclic service and the low decomposition temperature, the Mg–Mg2Ni system is shown to possess an excellent potential for long-term hydrogen and heat storage applications. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Cyclic performance; Hydrogen solid-state storage; Metal hydrides; Mg–Ni eutectic alloys","Activation energy; Binary alloys; Eutectics; Heat storage; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogen storage alloys; Magnesium alloys; Metal castings; Microstructure; Nickel alloys; Reaction kinetics; Cast ingots; Cyclic performance; Cyclic stability; Eutectic alloys; Hydrogen solid-state storage; Metal-hydrides; Mg-Ni alloys; Mg–ni eutectic alloy; Ni content; Solid-state storage; Hydrides"

The thermal effects due to sorption and desorption reactions of metal hydride hydrogen storage and fuel cell exhaust provide more than 50% of thermal load in each zone.

The hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reaction kinetics were studied, and reaction mechanisms were described by means of solid-gas reaction modeling. Absorption and desorption properties were evidenced to be diffusion controlled, with hydrogen diffusion through hydrided/dehydrided phases being the rate limiting step in most cases (the migration of metal/hydride interface at a constant velocity being rate-limiting in only few of them). The kinetics study was supported by a thorough thermal analysis to provide in-depth insights of the decomposition reaction. Hence, thermogravimetry (TG) and pressurized differential scanning calorimeter (PDSC) were combined to investigate the dehydrogenation properties such as hydrogen gravimetric density, reaction onset temperature, enthalpy and activation energy as a function of Ni content.

In spite of the resulting surface oxide layer formation, all specimens still absorbed hydrogen partly thanks to the presence of the C14 Laves phase. As expected, the first hydrogenation kinetics decreased with increasing air-exposure time, but atomized powders not only outperformed the reference counterparts but also remained quite competitive despite surface oxidation. The remarkable kinetic enhancement observed was attributed to the formation of an additional Ti2Fe phase, to an increased amount of C14 Laves phase, as well as to a fine microstructure resulting from the rapid cooling rate involved in gas atomization.

However, high dehydrogenation temperatures and slow dehydrogenation hamper broad applicability. One promising strategy to improve dehydrogenation is the formation of metastable γ-MgH2. A nanoparticle (NP) design, where γ-MgH2 forms intrinsically during hydrogenation is presented and a formation mechanism based on transmission electron microscopy results is proposed. Volume expansion during hydrogenation causes compressive stress within the confined, anisotropic NPs, leading to plastic deformation of β-MgH2 via (301)β twinning. It is proposed that these twins nucleate γ-MgH2 nanolamellas, which are stabilized by residual compressive stress. Understanding this mechanism is a crucial step toward cycle-stable, Mg-based dynamic plasmonic and hydrogen-storage materials with improved dehydrogenation.

Focusing on highly reactive (101¯ 0) edge planes where initial hydrogen attack is likely to occur, we track mechanistic steps toward the formation of hydrogen-saturated BH4- units and key chemical intermediates, involving H2 dissociation, generation of functionalities and molecular complexes containing BH2 and BH3 motifs, and B-B bond breaking. The genesis of higher-order boron clustering is also observed. Different charge states and chemical environments at the B-rich and Mg-rich edge planes are found to produce different chemical pathways and preferred speciation, with implications for overall hydrogenation kinetics. The reaction processes rely on B-H bond polarization and fluctuations between ionic and covalent character, which are critically enabled by the presence of Mg2+ cations in the nearby interphase region.

In this article, we have added Na to cast Mg–La alloys and achieved a significant improvement in hydrogen absorption kinetics during the first activation cycle. The role of Na in Mg–La has been discussed based on the findings from microstructural observations, crystallography, and first principles calculations based on density functional theory. From our results in this study, we have found that the Na doped surface of Mg–La alloy systems have a lower adsorption energy for H2 compared to Na-free surfaces which facilitates adsorption and dissociation of hydrogen molecules leading to improvement of absorption kinetic.

Yet, the discovery of novel hydriding materials has historically been a manual process driven by chemical intuition or experimental trial and error. Data-driven materials' discovery paradigms provide an alternative to traditional approaches, whereby machine/statistical learning (ML) models are used to efficiently screen materials for desired properties and significantly narrow the scope of expensive/time-consuming first-principles modeling and experimental validation. Here, we specifically focus on a relatively new class of hydrogen storage materials, high entropy alloy (HEA) hydrides, whose vast combinatorial composition space and local structural disorder necessitate a data-driven approach that does not rely on exact crystal structures to make property predictions. Our ML model quickly screens hydride stability within a large HEA space and permits down selection for laboratory validation based on not only targeted thermodynamic properties but also secondary criteria such as alloy phase stability and density. To experimentally verify our predictions, we performed targeted synthesis and characterization of several novel hydrides that demonstrate significant destabilization (70× increase in equilibrium pressure, 20 kJ/molH2 decrease in desorption enthalpy) relative to the benchmark HEA hydride, TiVZrNbHfHx. Ultimately, by providing a large composition space in which hydride thermodynamics can be continuously tuned over a wide range, this work will enable efficient material selection for various applications, especially in areas such as metal hydride-based hydrogen compressors, actuators, and heat pumps.  © ","","Digital storage; Entropy; Hydrides; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogen storage alloys; Stability criteria; Combinatorial composition; Data-driven approach; Experimental validations; First principles models; Hydrogen compressors; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Synthesis and characterizations; Traditional approaches; High-entropy alloys"

TixZr2-xCrMnFeNi (x = 0.4-1.6) alloys with the Laves phase structure and low hydrogen binding energies of -0.1 to -0.15 eV are designed and synthesized. The HEAs reversibly store hydrogen in the form of Laves phase hydrides at room temperature, while (de)hydrogenation pressure systematically reduces with increasing the zirconium fraction in good agreement with the binding energy calculations. The kinetics of hydrogenation are fast, the hydrogenation occurs without any activation or catalytic treatment, the hydrogen storage performance remains stable for at least 1000 cycles, and the storage capacity is higher than that for commercial LaNi5. The current findings demonstrate that a combination of theoretical calculations and experiments is a promising pathway to design new high-entropy hydrides with high performance for hydrogen storage. © 2022","Density functional theory (DFT); High-entropy alloy (HEA); Laves phase; Metal hydrides; Solid-state hydrogen storage","Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Binding energy; Calculations; Density functional theory; Design for testability; Entropy; High-entropy alloys; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage alloys; Hydrogenation; Iron alloys; Manganese alloys; Titanium alloys; Zircaloy; Density functional theory; Density-functional-theory; First principle calculations; High entropy alloys; High-entropy alloy; Laves phasis; Laves-phase; Metal-hydrides; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Temperature binding energies; Hydrogen storage"

In doing so, nanosized AB is destabilized and shows better dehydrogenation properties than bulk AB in terms of temperature, activation energy, enthalpy and kinetics. Such improvements are due to the confinement-driven nanosizing effect, but not only. A catalytic effect may also have a contribution and, in some cases, it even overpasses the nanosizing effect. These effects are explained in detail herein. The present review aims at reporting the outcomes of the AB confinement strategy to help understand the advantages and to identify the limitations which are still not adequately defined. Based on this analysis, the challenges ahead are listed and discussed, and it appears that there are new opportunities to explore.

However, fully mapping the stabilities of known or newly targeted compounds relative to competing phases at reaction conditions has previously required many stringent experiments or computationally demanding calculations of each compound's change in Gibbs energy with respect to temperature, G(T). In this work, we have extended the approach of constructing chemical potential phase diagrams based on ΔGf(T) to enable the analysis of phase stability at non-zero temperatures. We first performed density functional theory calculations to compute the formation enthalpies of binary, ternary, and quaternary compounds within several compositional spaces of current interest for solid-state hydrogen storage. Temperature effects on solid compound stability were then accounted for using our recently introduced machine learned descriptor for the temperaturedependent contribution Gδ(T) to the Gibbs energy G(T). From these Gibbs energies, we evaluated each compound's stability relative to competing compounds over a wide range of conditions and show using chemical potential and composition phase diagrams that the predicted stable phases and H2 release reactions are consistent with experimental observations. This demonstrates that our approach rapidly computes the thermochemistry of hydrogen release reactions for compounds at sufficiently high accuracy relative to experiment to provide a powerful framework for analyzing hydrogen storage materials. This framework based on G(T) enables the accelerated discovery of active materials for a variety of technologies that rely on solid-state reactions involving these materials.  © 2020 American Chemical Society.","Chemical potential; Density functional theory; Free-energy phase diagrams; High-throughput; Hydrogen storage; Solid-state chemistry; Thermodynamic stability","Chemical analysis; Chemical potential; Chemical stability; Density functional theory; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Hydrogen storage; Phase diagrams; Formation enthalpy; Quaternary compound; Reaction conditions; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Solid-state materials; Temperature and pressures; Temperature dependent; Zero temperatures; Solid state reactions"

The key to understanding the hydrogen storage behaviour lies in the nanoscale structure of the hybrid and the associated mechanisms. The focus of the current study is on the use of cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to unravel the underlying mechanisms of hydrogen storage, in the Mg-LaNi5-Soot hybrid. The role of processing variables (ARB passes and strain) and the concomitant evolution of the microstructure (distribution of second phase particles (LaNi5 and soot)) are studied, keeping in view the diffusion of hydrogen and the nucleation of the hydride phase. It is established that the interface between Mg and second phase (LaNi5 and soot) plays a dominant role in the nucleation of the MgH2 phase. The MgH2 nucleation mechanism is studied under the ambit of the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami kinetic (JMAK) model.

Hydrogen is eco-friendly, renewable, and green. The synthesis and development of materials with great potential for hydrogen storage is still a challenge in research and needs to be addressed to store hydrogen economically and efficiently. Various solid-state materials have been fabricated for hydrogen energy storage; however, carbon-based nanocomposites have gained more attention because of its high surface area, low processing cost, and light weight nature. Carbon materials are easy to modify with various metals, metal oxides (MOs), and other organometallic frameworks because of the functional groups available on the surface and edges that increase the storage capacity of hydrogen. In addition, chemisorption is another way to enhance the hydrogen storage capacity of carbon-based nanocomposites. In this review, we discuss the success achieved thus far and the challenges that remain for the physical and chemical storage of hydrogen in various carbon-based nanocomposites. Various compositions of catalysts (eg, metal, MOs, alloy, metal organic frameworks) and carbon materials are designed for hydrogen storage. Superior energy storage in hybrids and composites as compared with pristine materials (catalysts or carbon nanotubes) is governed by the interaction, activation, and hydrogen adsorption/absorption mechanism of materials in the reaction profile. (Nano)composites comprising carbon material with metals, MOs, or alloys are important in this field, not only because of their potential for hydrogen sorption but also their significant cyclic stability and high efficiency upon successive adsorption-desorption cycles. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","carbon nanotubes; graphene oxide; hydrogen; nanocomposites; renewable energy","Gas adsorption; Hydrogen fuels; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Metals; Nanocatalysts; Nanocomposites; Organometallics; Adsorption-desorption cycles; Alternative energy source; Hydrogen adsorption; Hydrogen energy storages; Hydrogen storage capacities; Scientific community; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Solid-state materials; Hydrogen storage"

Herein, it was confirmed that CoMoO4 sheet-like nanocatalysts uniformly supported on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (CoMoO4/rGO) were successfully prepared by a simple hydrothermal reaction. The novel CoMoO4/rGO catalyst was subsequently doped into MgH2 to improve its hydrogen storage performance. MgH2–10 wt% CoMoO4/rGO starts to release hydrogen at around 204 °C, which is about 36 °C and 156 °C lower than that of MgH2 −10 wt%CoMoO4 and pure MgH2, respectively. In addition, 6.25 wt% H2 can be released within 10 min at 300 °C. After complete dehydrogenation, H2 can be absorbed below 80 °C. Meanwhile, it can absorb 4.2 wt% H2 in 20 min under the condition of 150 °C and 3 MPa. Moreover, the activation energy of hydrogen absorption and dehydrogenation of MgH2–10 wt%CoMoO4/rGO composites are reduced by 31.44 kJ mol−1 and 33.78 kJ mol−1, respectively, compared with pure MgH2. Cycling experiment shows that the MgH2–10 wt%CoMoO4/rGO composite system can still maintain about 98% of the hydrogen storage capacity after 10 cycles. Furthermore, studies on the catalytic mechanism show that the synergistic effect between the in-situ generated MgO, Co7Mo6 and Mo may help to promote the diffusion of H2, thereby improving the MgH2 Hydrogen storage properties. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Catalyst; CoMoO<sub>4</sub>; Graphene; Hydrogen storage material; MgH<sub>2</sub>","Activation energy; Binary alloys; Dehydrogenation; Hydrogen storage; Magnesia; Nanocatalysts; Carbon-based; Higher efficiency; Hydrogen storage materials; Multifunctional catalysts; Nano-catalyst; Reduced graphene oxides; Sheet-like; Simple++; Solid-state hydrogen storage; ]+ catalyst; Graphene"

Hydrogen release from Mg(BH4)2 occurs through several steps. The reaction intermediates formed at these steps have been extensively studied for a decade. In this work, we apply spectroscopic methods that have rarely been used in such studies to provide alternative insights into the nature of the reaction intermediates. The commercially obtained sample was decomposed in argon flow during thermogravimetric analysis combined with differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC) to differentiate between the H2-desorption reaction steps. The reaction products were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), near edge soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy at boron K-edge (NEXAFS), and synchrotron infrared (IR) spectroscopy in mid- and far-IR ranges (SR-FTIR). Up to 12 wt% of H2 desorption was observed in the gravimetric measurements. PXRD showed no crystalline decomposition products when heated at 260–280 °C, the formation of MgH2 above 300 °C, and Mg above 320 °C. The qualitative analysis of the NEXAFS data showed the presence of boron in lower oxidation states than in (BH4)−. The NEXAFS data also indicated the presence of amorphous boron at and above 340 °C.

The proposed LPM is a zero-dimensional model based on an analogous transient thermal resistance network that considers the whole storage system as a resistor–capacitor (RC) circuit with a current source. Combined with the mass conservation, sorption kinetics, and equation of state, the LPM is capable of predicting key thermofluidic quantities of the storage system, such as the storage bed temperature and pressure, hydrogen fraction and flowrate, and storage tank temperature. To test the applicability of the LPM, chemisorptive (Mg and LaNi5) and physisorptive (activated carbon) solid-state materials are simulated for adsorption and desorption processes. For both material types, LPM achieves predictive accuracies comparable to three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, especially for hydrogen fraction and storage times (with maximum errors less than 9.6%), for a fraction of the computational cost (23,734 times lower memory requirement and 126 times faster calculation time). In addition, several formulations of the bed thermal resistance are proposed and discussed in terms of their impact on the accuracy of the LPM predictions.

The rehydrogenation of MgB2 is particularly challenging, requiring prolonged exposure to high pressures of hydrogen at high temperature. Here we report an XPS study probing the influence of LiH and TiH2 on the hydrogen storage properties of MgB2 in the surface and near-surface regions, as a complementary investigation to a preceding study of the bulk properties. Surface and near-surface properties are important considerations for nanoscale and bulk hydrogen storage materials. If there are reactions occurring at the surface that modify the chemical composition in the near-surface region, species diffusion can alter the chemical composition even deep into the bulk of the material. For LiH/MgB2, metastable LiH–B and LiH–Mg species are produced that are more reactive than Bulk MgB2. With prolonged glovebox storage, the LiH/MgB2 material shows increased reactivity towards O and C and enriched levels of Li and B in the near-surface region. In addition, Li induces the growth of Li2CO3 in the surface and near surface regions. Exposing LiH/MgB2 to hydrogen at 700 bar and 280 °C for 24 h produces borohydride at a temperature 100 °C below the threshold for bulk MgB2 hydrogenation. In a specifically surface process with macroscopic implications, the hydrogenation conditions also cause Li2CO3 to react with boron hydroxide in the sample to form a Li-deficient glassy lithium borate melt at the interfaces of the particles, bonding them together. Subsequent heating to 380 °C dehydrogenates the borohydride and eliminates the Li-deficient glassy lithium borate. The LiH/MgB2 material is not reversible because desorption does not lead back to LiH/MgB2, but rather to elemental B and Mg metal in the near-surface region. In contrast to LiH, TiH2 does not react with MgB2, despite the favorable thermodynamics for destabilization via TiB2 formation. Furthermore, high pressure hydrogenation yields only unreacted TiH2 and MgB2 in the surface and near-surface regions. Thus, added TiH2 provides no benefit to MgB2 hydrogenation, in agreement with the findings of the preceding bulk study. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Additive; Hydrogen storage; Lithium hydride; Magnesium diboride; XPS","Additives; Chemical bonds; Glass; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation; Lithium compounds; Magnesium; Magnesium compounds; Surface properties; Surface reactions; Thermodynamics; Titanium compounds; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Borohydrides; Chemical compositions; High pressure; Highest temperature; Hydrogen storage materials; Magnesium diborides; Near surface regions; Near surfaces; Rehydrogenation; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Hydrides"

Al, Be, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn and Ni were selected as substitutional elements for Fe sites, in the light of their reported enhancement of activation, kinetic and thermodynamic properties. The use of special quasi-random structures to account for disordering of solute elements in the sub-lattice allowed a quantitative assessment of substitutional effects on the hydrogenation behaviour of single-phase TiFe1-xMx alloys, up to a solute concentration as high as 40 at.%. The energy of monohydride formation obtained by DFT calculations, approximated to the enthalpy of formation, was discussed in terms of changes in lattice parameter and hence plateau pressure. Based on the consistency between DFT calculations and earlier experimental results, a linear relationship between monohydride formation energy/enthalpy and plateau pressure was proposed as a simple method to predict the value of one of these physical properties from the other. The obtained correlation could therefore turn out to be a helpful tool to predict the ab/desorption plateau pressure of unexplored vast multi-component systems from DFT calculation, or, the other way around, could allow to estimate the formation enthalpy from only one pressure-composition-isotherm (PCI) measurement hence without the need of Van't Hoff plot. © 2022 The Author(s)","Density functional theory calculation; Elemental substitution; Hydrogen solid-state storage; Metal hydrides; TiFe alloys","Binary alloys; Calculations; Computation theory; Density functional theory; Enthalpy; Forecasting; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogen storage alloys; Hydrogenation; Iron alloys; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Density-functional theory calculations; Elemental substitution; Experimental methods; First-principle density-functional theories; Hydrogen solid-state storage; Metal-hydrides; Monohydrides; Plateau pressures; Solid-state storage; TiFe alloys; Hydrides"

Here, using such processed samples, a comprehensive analysis of the sorption properties reveals that the first hydrogenation sequence significantly depends on the forging temperature, through different microstructures. More in detail, no phase transformation occurs upon cold forging, while solid-state reaction leads to the formation of the Mg2Ni intermetallic compound upon forging above 400 °C. Forging below the brittle-to-ductile transition (225-250 °C) leads to faster H2 uptake upon first absorption owing to a more textured fiber along the c-axis and internal strains which promote hydrogen diffusion through the bulk material. Desorption kinetics remain slower with low-temperature forging, despite Ni recombining to form Mg2Ni during the first desorption. After several cycles, a two-step behavior is observed with a fast absorption step occurring up to about 3 wt.%. Despite this limited uptake performance, the forging process can be considered as a straightforward, safe, and cost-efficient process to produce large amounts of Mg-based alloys for hydrogen storage. In particular, such severe plastic deformation processes can be considered as reliable substitutes for ball-milling, which is highly efficient but energy- and time-consuming.  © 2020 by the authors.","Eutectic alloys; Forging; Hydrogen storage; Metal hydrides; Mg-Ni; Severe plastic deformation","Ball milling; Binary alloys; Desorption; Forging; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogen storage alloys; Nickel alloys; Plastic deformation; Powders; Solid state reactions; Temperature; Textures; Brittle to ductile transition; Comprehensive analysis; Desorption kinetics; H2 sorption properties; Hydrogen storage properties; Severe plastic deformation process; Severe plastic deformations; Sorption properties; Magnesium alloys"

Since these alloys present exceptional formability, they can be processed by extensive cold rolling (ECR), which can improve hydrogen sorption properties. This work investigated the effects of ECR accomplished under an inert atmosphere on H2 sorption properties of the arc melted and rapidly solidified β Ti40Nb alloy. Samples were crushed in a rolling mill producing slightly deformed pieces within the millimeter range size, which were processed by ECR with 40 or 80 passes. Part of undeformed fragments was used for comparison purposes. All samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffractometry, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, hydrogen volumetry, and differential scanning calorimetry. After ECR, samples deformed with 40 passes were formed by thick sheets, while several thin layers composed the specimens after 80 passages. Furthermore, deformation of β Ti–40Nb alloys synthesized samples containing a high density of crystalline defects, cracks, and stored strain energy that increased with the deformation amount and proportionally helped to overcome the diffusion's control mechanisms, thus improving kinetic behaviors at low temperature. Such an improvement was also correlated to the synergetic effect of resulting features after deformation and thickness of stacked layers in the different deformation conditions. At the room temperature, samples deformed with 80 passes absorbed ∼2.0 wt% of H2 after 15 min, while samples deformed with 40 passes absorbed ∼1.8 wt% during 2 h, excellent results if compared with undeformed samples hydrogenated at 300 °C that acquired a capacity of ∼1.7 wt% after 2 h. The hydrogen desorption evolved in the same way as for absorption regarding the deformation amount, which also influenced desorption temperatures that were reduced from ∼270 °C, observed for the undeformed and samples deformed with 40 passes, to ∼220 °C, for specimens rolled with 80 passes.

The surface adsorption and the encapsulated storage of H2 molecules in a cagelike (MgO)12 cluster have been studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations including a dispersion interaction. The results revealed that the cagelike (MgO)12 cluster surface can adsorb 24 H2 molecules with an average adsorption energy of 0.116 eV/H2, which brings about a gravimetric density of 9.1 wt%. Compared with dispersion-corrected DFT calculations, the traditional DFT method substantially underestimates the surface adsorption strength.

The metal hydride powders, obtained after 200 h of reactive ball milling was doped with 10 wt% TiMn2 powders and high-energy ball milled under pressurized hydrogen of 70 bar for 50 h. The cold-pressing technique was used to consolidate them into 36-green buttons with 12 mm in diameter. During consolidation, the hard TiMn2 spherical powders deeply embedded into MgH2 matrix to form homogeneous nanocomposite bulk material. The apparent activation energies of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation for the fabricated buttons were 19.3 kJ/mol and 82.9 kJ/mol, respectively. The present MgH2/10 wt% TiMn2 nanocomposite binary system possessed superior hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics at 225 °C to absorb/desorb 5.1 wt% hydrogen at 10 bar/200 mbar H2 within 100 s and 400 s, respectively. This new system revealed good cyclability of achieving 414 cycles within 600 h continuously without degradations. For the present study, the consolidated buttons were used as solid-state hydrogen storage for feeding proton-exchange membrane fuel cell through a house made Ti-reactor at 250 °C.

In this paper, Mn3O4 nanoparticles with a uniform size of around 10 nm were synthesized by a facile chemical method and then introduced to modify the hydrogen storage properties of MgH2. With the addition of 10 wt% Mn3O4 nanoparticles, the MgH2-Mn3O4 composite started to release hydrogen at 200 °C and approximately 6.8 wt% H2 could be released within 8 min at 300 °C. For absorption, the completely dehydrogenated sample took up 5.0 wt% H2 within 10 min under 3 MPa hydrogen even at 100 °C. Compared with pristine MgH2, the activation energy value of absorption for the MgH2 + 10 wt% Mn3O4 composite decreased from 72.5 ± 2.7 to 34.4 ± 0.9 kJ mol-1. The catalytic mechanism of Mn3O4 was also explored and discussed with solid evidence from X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) studies. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the Mg-H bonds were elongated and weakened with the doping of Mn3O4. In addition, a cycling test showed that the hydrogen storage capacity and reaction kinetics of MgH2-Mn3O4 could be favourably preserved in 20 cycles, indicative of promising applications as a solid-state hydrogen storage material in a future hydrogen society.

However, the poor de/rehydrogenation kinetics and strong stability of MgH2 must be improved before proposing this material for applications. Doping MgH2 powders with one or more catalytic agents is one common approach leading to obvious improving on the behavior of MgH2. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of doping MgH2 with 7 wt% of amorphous(a)-LaNi3 nanopowders on hydrogenation/dehydrogenation behavior of the metal hydride powders. The results have shown that rod milling MgH2 with a-LaNi3 abrasive nanopowders led to disintegrate microscale-MgH2 powders to nanolevel. The final nanocomposite product obtained after 50 h–100 h of rod milling revealed superior hydrogenation kinetics, indexed by short time (8 min) required to absorb 6 wt% of H2 at 200◦C/10 bar. At 225◦C/200 mbar, nanocomposite powders revealed outstanding dehydrogenation kinetics, characterized by very short time (2 min) needed to release 6 wt% of H2.

Unfortunately, high dehydrogenation temperatures and relatively slow kinetics limit its practical applications. Herein, 3D flower-like nanocrystalline Ni/C, composed of highly dispersed Ni nanoparticles and interlaced carbon flakes, was synthesized in situ. The as-synthesized nanocrystalline Ni/C significantly decreased the dehydrogenation temperature and dramatically improved the dehydrogenation kinetics of LiAlH4. It was found that the LiAlH4 sample with 10 wt % Ni/C (LiAlH4-10 wt %Ni/C) began hydrogen desorption at approximately 48 °C, which is very close to ambient temperature. Approximately 6.3 wt % H2 was released from LiAlH4-10 wt %Ni/C within 60 min at 140 °C, whereas pristine LiAlH4 only released 0.52 wt % H2 under identical conditions. More importantly, the dehydrogenated products can partially rehydrogenate at 300 °C under 4 MPa H2.

The alloys have body-centred cubic (bcc) crystal structures and form face-centred cubic (fcc) metal hydrides with hydrogen-to-metal ratios close to 2 by hydrogenation. The onset temperature for hydrogen desorption, Tonset, decreases linearly with the valence-electron concentration, VEC. Moreover, the volumetric expansion per metal atom from the bcc alloys to the fcc hydrides, [(V/Z)fcc−(V/Z)bcc]/(V/Z)bcc, increases linearly with the VEC. Therefore, it seems that a larger expansion of the lattice destabilizes the metal hydrides and that this effect can be tuned by altering the VEC. Kissinger analyses performed on the DSC measurements indicate that the destabilization is a thermodynamic rather than kinetic effect. Based upon these insights we have identified TiVCrNbH8 as a material with suitable thermodynamics for hydrogen storage in the solid state.

It sets out analyzing the basic principles for producing the porous nano-crystalline thin films using the Ion-Beam Assisted Deposition (IBAD) technique. The detailed analysis of electron microscopic investigation of the film structure at all growth stages (from 5 nm to 1 μm) is provided. It is shown how the bombardment with gas ions during the film deposition contributes to a formation of intergranular nanopores. The size of nanopores and their distribution were determined by means of neutron spectroscopy analysis. Using the nuclear-physical methods, the total volume of intergranular pores was measured and it was shown that, depending on the parameters of the IBAD process, the porosity can vary from 10 to 27 vol. %. It was noted that nuclear physics methods are also relevant for determining the hydrogen amount absorbed by thin films. The review contains the results of research regarding the influence of the film thickness, the presence of a protective nickel coating, and the hydrogen saturation technique on the gravimetric capacity of the films. Investigated nanoporous (V, Ti)Nx-Hy thin films can absorb up to 8 wt. % of hydrogen, and hydrogen release occurs in the temperature range from 50 to 350°C.

Using experimental and first-principles calculations approaches, we, for the first time, investigate the catalytic effect and mechanism of nickel phthalocyanine on the dehydrogenation properties of MgH2. The results display that a small amount of nickel phthalocyanine can promote MgH2 dehydrogenation at significantly decreased temperatures by more than 90 °C relative to milled pristine or graphene-added MgH2 system. However, the agglomeration of MgH2 particles is not evidently alleviated through nickel phthalocyanine addition. When MgH2 is milled with graphene firstly and then the obtained mixture is further milled with nickel phthalocyanine, the dehydrogenation properties and agglomeration of MgH2 particles can be synergistically improved to some extent. The first-principles calculations of dehydrogenation enthalpy and binding energy account for the experimental differences in catalysis and aggregation-resistance abilities of nickel phthalocyanine and graphene on MgH2 particles. Notably, the NiN4-inserted graphene is predicted to be an ideal additive for MgH2, which combines the synergetic catalysis-confinement effect of nickel phthalocyanine and graphene on MgH2 particles. Analysis of electronic structures reveals that the excellent catalytic effect of nickel phthalocyanine on MgH2 can be ascribed to the more electron transfer between nickel phthalocyanine and MgH2, which induces the significantly weakened bond strength of Mg[sbnd]H and decreased dehydrogenation enthalpy of MgH2. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Aggregation-resistance; Catalysis; Dehydrogenation properties; Magnesium hydride; Nickel phthalocyanine","Agglomeration; Binding energy; Calculations; Catalysis; Dehydrogenation; Electronic structure; Enthalpy; Graphene; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Magnesium; Nickel; Nickel compounds; Aggregation resistance; Dehydrogenation properties; First-principles calculation; First-principles study; Hydrogen storage properties; Magnesium hydride; Nickel phthalocyanines; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Magnesium compounds"

Recently developed metal hydride composites (MHC) consist of a hydride-forming metal alloy and a secondary phase, typically graphite, to realize form-stable composites and short loading and unloading times (<5 min). Hydride formation causes a volume expansion of the storage material. Thus, it is mandatory to characterize this behavior for the sake of system safety. This work focuses on the in-operando characterization of the volume expansion of MHC that could trigger mechanical stresses acting on the walls and internal assemblies of the storage container. MHC with different metal particle shapes (flakes and powder) were studied. In-operando neutron imaging of axially freely expanding MHC was applied to analyze the time-resolved and spatial concentration of hydrogen, reaction fronts and the evolution of volume expansion and stability of the MHC. Stress measurements revealed that stresses of up to 330% of the respective operating gas pressure occur for confined MHC. Both techniques combined deliver crucial information and implications for the design of safe (according to ISO 16111), efficient and dynamic metal hydride storage systems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Metal hydride composites (MHC); Neutron imaging; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Storage system design; Stress measurement; Volume expansion","Complexation; Expansion; Hydrides; Metal working; Metals; Neutrons; Stress measurement; Stresses; Unloading; Metal hydrides; Neutron imaging; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Storage systems; Volume expansion; Hydrogen storage"

The surface area of the NBM was around 420.5 m2/g totally. High pore volume, high internal surface area, lightweight as well as easy availability are some features that attract research interests on activated carbon as a solid-state hydrogen storage medium. Nano biomass was deposited directly on a copper substrate by the slurry-coating method. The electrochemical properties of nano biomass were investigated in a three-electrode electrolytic cell with 6 M KOH as the electrolyte by galvanostatic charging and discharging. Several parameters such as the impact of the number of charge and discharge cycles and discharge time are studied. Different experimental results show that Cu-NBM has 1596 mAh/g discharge capacity (corresponding to a hydrogen storage capacity of 5.66 wt%) after 16 cycles at room temperature and atmospheric conditions.

It is found that the initial desorption temperature of LiBH4@2Ti3C2 hybrid decreases to 172.6 °C and releases 9.6 wt % hydrogen at 380 °C within 1 h, whereas pristine LiBH4 only releases 3.2 wt % hydrogen under identical conditions. More importantly, the dehydrogenated products can partially rehydrogenate at 300 °C and under 95 bar H2.

Three parallel H2 release mechanisms have been identified from the BMAS powder. These include (i) H2 release from the decomposition of nano-LiBH4 and then Li2B12H12 decomposition product reacts with nano-MgH2 to release H2, (ii) H2 release from the decomposition of nano-Mg(BH4)2, and (iii) H2 release from the decomposition of nano-MgH2. Together, these three mechanisms result in 4.11 wt% H2 release in the solid-state at temperature ≤265 °C, which is among the highest quantities ever reported for LiBH4 + MgH2 mixtures to date. Furthermore, the H2 release temperature for each mechanism described above is lower than the corresponding temperature reported using other synthesis methods. In addition, the predicted property of a small amount of the Fe3B phase in the BMAS powder in absorbing more H2 than releasing is confirmed experimentally for the first time in this study.

There is no doubt that metal hydrides continue to attract the overall materials science community, and it is not only restrained to a specialized hydrogen field. This is mainly the case when it is the matter of coupled technologies with other systems such as fuel cells, heat management, and batteries. Hydrogen is considered an energy carrier and its chemical energy can be converted into electricity through a chemical reaction with oxygen from a fuel cell. Therefore, coupling energy storage systems with renewable energy sources through an electrolyzer, which can transform electric energy into hydrogen chemical energy, is considered a high sustainable process of production and exploitation of renewable energies. Integrated systems are constituted by a metal hydride tank and a PEM fuel cell, in which the waste heat generated in the fuel cell is used to supply the necessary heat required for desorption of hydrogen from the tank. The field of application of the integrated power system is in combination with renewable sources: The hydrogen can be produced by electrolysis of water using the energy from a renewable source (e.g., photovoltaic); it is then stored and converted into electric energy by the proposed integrated power system, that allows energy storage in the form of hydrogen and its reuse when the renewable source is not available, for example, at night if solar power is exploited. The developed power system could replace batteries and could be applied in the case of a production plant not connected to the power grid, such as in remote areas. As an example, an integrated power system, showing a total energy production of 4.8 kW h, over more than 6 h of working activity, is reported in ref 4. In the SSH2S (Fuel Cell Coupled Solid-State Hydrogen Storage Tank) project, a solid-state hydrogen storage tank based on complex hydrides has been developed and it was fully integrated with a High-Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane (HT-PEM) fuel cell stack. The hydrogen storage tank was designed to feed a 1 kW HT-PEM stack for 2 h to be used for an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU).61 With respect to batteries, hydrides can be utilized as anodes with high capacity (e.g., 2 Ahg-1 for MgH2). A lot of effort has been expended to improve the cyclability, and significant results have been reached in a solid-state battery with LiBH4 solid electrolyte. Demonstration of high-energy density fuel cells with suitable cathodes will be the challenge of upcoming research studies.62,63 As mentioned for the beneficial contribution of electrodes, solid-state electrolytes based on borohydrides are a typical example that the battery community is now taking seriously along with the popular garnet-type solid electrolytes.64,65 It has been demonstrated that the ionic conductivity is a prerequisite for application in batteries, but unfortunately it is not win; in fact, other important issues need to be tackled, such as chemical compatibility, interfaces, heterogeneity, and mechanical properties, so important for the cell engineering and design, in addition to the structural and volumetric changes during cycling. At first, borohydrides meet some of these criteria regarding conductivity and ductility, (thermo)chemistry, and low-density materials. Future research might be directed to the understanding and assessment of interfaces and physical and mechanical properties of the selected solid-electrolyte and electrodes. The specificity of the application may become a determining aspect in the selection of the suitable configuration. Substantial research efforts are being conducted to study new approaches toward the utilization of borohydrides and closo-type complex hydrides in composites.66,67 Thanks to their ductility and ionic conductivity, borohydrides can be also employed as additives for binder-free solid-state batteries. Since the demonstration of LiBH4 thin film growth,68 this could be considered for mitigating the formation of dendrite and oxidation layers on the surface of lithium metal. Another direction is focused on the development of Mg2+ conducting solid electrolytes for application in Mg batteries, which offer higher volumetric capacity compared to lithium at low cost. At present, the technology can be only possible at high-T owing to the low ionic conductivity and Mg2+-ion mobility.69 In addition, metal hydrides can be utilized as optical hydrogen sensors for the detection of hydrogen at low pressure levels according to changes in the optical properties, which is a step forward regarding the increase of the safety for advanced hydrogenbased systems. Lastly, compared to the traditional conferences for hydrogen community (MH, E-MRS, Gordon, etc.) there no doubt that IRSEC is a particular place to meet scientists and experts in the African context undergoing full energy boom. The eighth edition of IRSEC will continue the tradition of drawing the best scientists in the field of sustainable energy, which will be held in Tangier (Morocco), November 25-28, 2020.

Taking MgH2 as hydrogen donor, thiophene hydrodesulfurization has taken place at atmospheric pressure and at the temperature lower than the onset desorption temperature, indicating that a coupling effect occurs between MgH2 decomposition and thiophene hydrogenation. It is further revealed that sulfur removal in thiophene under the studied condition preferentially proceeds via direct desulfurization (DDS) route.

Using experimental and first-principles calculations approaches, the dehydrogenation properties and modifying mechanisms of NaBH4+10 wt%graphene composite acquired by ball-milling are systematically investigated in this work. The results show that the graphene plays a cooperative catalysis–confinement effect on NaBH4. X-ray diffraction analysis displays that no new phases formed due to the mutual inertia between NaBH4 and graphene during ball-milling. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy observations show that the NaBH4 particles are significantly refined after graphene addition, which effectively restrains the agglomeration of NaBH4 particles. Thermogravimetry testing and mass spectrometry testing indicate that the onset dehydrogenation temperature of the NaBH4+10 wt%graphene composite is decreased by about 114 °C relative to the milled pristine NaBH4.

Among the studied compositions, 6Mg(NH2)2[sbnd]9LiH[sbnd]2LiBH4 showed the best hydrogen storage properties. The presence of 2 mol of LiBH4 improved the thermal behaviour of the 6Mg(NH2)2[sbnd]9LiH by lowering the dehydrogenation peak temperature nearly 25 °C and by reducing the apparent dehydrogenation activation energy of about 40 kJ/mol.

The objective was to design and optimize a solid-state hydrogen storage for a nonpolluting mobility. A study of the absorption and desorption dynamics of a loose powder bed was performed first, followed by three different storage bed configurations: compacted Ti-Mn alloy powder, alternated Ti-Mn alloy compacts with stainless steel fins and compacted [Ti-Mn alloy/Stainless steel] powder mixture. A numerical model was developed to simulate the heat transfer and the hydrogen absorption and desorption rates. The alternation and compact mixture configurations gave better heat transfer efficiencies, absorption and desorption rates and increased hydrogen storage densities. Indeed, an efficient heat transfer (between the tank and its surrounding fluid), a tailored porosity of the metal hydride storage bed and the addition of high thermal conductivity materials allowed the overall storage performance to be improved. Thus, the required time for loading/unloading hydrogen was reduced drastically. The alternation configuration would offer the additional advantage of a simple, inexpensive and efficient recycling procedure. © 2019","AB2; Heat and mass transfer; Hydrogen storage bed design; Numerical MATLAB based simulation; Solid-state hydrogen storage","Binary alloys; Desorption; Heat transfer performance; Hydrides; Manganese alloys; Manganese steel; Mass transfer; MATLAB; Mixtures; Powder metals; Tanks (containers); Titanium alloys; Absorption and desorptions; Heat and mass transfer; Heat transfer efficiency; High thermal conductivity; Metal hydride storage; Numerical MATLAB based simulation; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Storage beds; Hydrogen storage"

In such devices, metal hydrides fulfill the functions of both a cathode and the solid-state generator of working gas. Their advantages are high purity of gas injected (99.99 - 99.999%), along with the safety and compactness in storage. Hydrogen is injected (desorbed) locally under the influence of ion bombardment of metal hydride surface, which fact provides return coupling between the intensity of gas desorption and the parameters of gas discharge. The rate of sputtering for those materials by plasma ions significantly reduces as well as heat loads. Above effect is achieved due to the creation of protective gas target as a result of both the thermal decomposition of metal hydride and ion stimulated desorption. The feature of metal hydride cathode under the conditions of gas discharge is a decrease in the ionization potential of desorbed hydrogen by 0.3-0.5 eV due to the molecules desorption in the vibrationally/rotationally excited state. This permits a substantially increase in ionization efficiency and the formation of negative ions by the mechanism of dissociative attachment in plasma volume. However, hydrogen desorbed from metal hydride significantly changes the properties of the discharge.

A novel method of solid-state storage using catalytically-modified porous silicon can be fabricated entirely from materials found on the Moon and in asteroids, requiring only a fixed quantity of reusable reagents to be brought from Earth. Consumables include silicon, aluminum, iron, and water, all of which can be extracted from suitable regolith ore bodies. An aluminum pressure vessel containing granular porous silicon particles is recharged by hydrogen pressures of 0.8 MPa. Once charged, the hydrogen storage subsystem can be maintained at any temperature from 0 to 373 K for an indefinite period, suitable for lunar nights or months-long trips to main-belt asteroids. Discharge is facilitated by heating above 393 K, provided by IR, resistive, or metal foam heat conductors embedded in the particulate bed. Systems-level volumetric and gravimetric storage metrics are 39 g/l and 5.8 percent w/w, respectively, comparable to cryogenic hydrogen storage in size and mass. The embodied energy in storing the hydrogen is very small, less than 2 percent of the embodied chemical energy, which makes it more efficient than cryogenic at 40 percent. Silicon and aluminum can be extracted from regolith using isotopic separation by charge/mass ratio. Iron and nickel are harvested from lunar regolith by electromagnets and used as the catalyst to mediate between gaseous hydrogen and monatomic surface adsorbed hydrogen. Deposition is accomplished via carbonyl gases, which require a quantity of CO, which is recovered after each use. Making the silicon porous requires hydrofluoric acid (HF), which will need to be supplied from Earth. The hydrofluorosilicic acid byproduct can be heated to decompose into HF vapor and silicon dioxide. The HF is condensed and re-used, and the silicon dioxide is a waste byproduct, which can be formed into quartz objects such as portals and glassware. A lunar factory with a mass of 7.5 MT can produce complete hydrogen storage vessels, assuming that electronic control can be provided by the remainder of the power system. With granular media, the size and shape of such vessels are essentially constrained. One example is two-meter thick shell sections for a deep space crew cabin for radiation protection. The hydrogen therein could be withdrawn as a back-up supply of fuel, or for a final Hohman transfer burn just before refueling. © 2020 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

ABy compounds (A = Rare Earth (RE); B = transition metal; 2 < y < 5) are good candidates to fulfill the required properties for practical applications. They can be described as stacking of [AB5] and [AB2] sub-units along the c crystallographic axis. The latter sub-unit brings a larger capacity, while the former one provides a better cycling stability. However, ABy binaries do not show good enough properties for applications. Upon hydrogenation, they exhibit multiplateau behavior and poor reversibility, attributed to H-induced amorphization. These drawbacks can be overcome by chemical substitutions on the A and/or the B sites leading to stabilized reversible hydrides. The present work focuses on the pseudo-binary Sm2MnxNi7-x system (0 ≤ x < 0.5). The structural, thermodynamic and corrosion properties are analyzed and interpreted by means of X-ray diffraction, chemical analysis, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and magnetic measurements. Unexpected cell parameter variations are reported and interpreted regarding possible formation of structural defects and uneven Mn distribution within the Ni sublattice. Reversible capacity is improved for x > 0.3 leading to larger and flatter isotherm curves, allowing for reversible capacity >1.4 wt %. Regarding corrosion, the binary compound corrodes in alkaline medium to form rare earth hydroxide and nanoporous nickel. As for the Mn-substituted compounds, a new corrosion product is formed in addition to those above mentioned, as manganese initiates a sacrificial anode mechanism taking place at the early corrosion stage.  © 2020 by the authors.","Corrosion; Magnetic measurements; Metallic hydrides; Ni-MH batteries; Rare earths","Alkalinity; Anodes; Cathodic protection; Chemical analysis; Corrosive effects; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Intermetallics; Manganese alloys; Manganese metallography; Nickel metallography; Rare earth compounds; Rare earths; Samarium alloys; Scanning electron microscopy; Solid-State Batteries; Ternary alloys; Thermogravimetric analysis; Transition metals; Chemical substitution; Corrosion products; Crystallographic axis; Rare earth hydroxide; Reversible capacity; Reversible hydrides; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Substituted compounds; Manganese compounds"

In this regard, chemical storage of hydrogen in solid state of metal hydrides is the safest method for stationary and portable applications since these can be functioned at lower pressure and ambient temperature. Among the desirable metal hydrides, the intermetallic compound TiFe of cubic CsCl-type structure is well known for absorbing hydrogen reversibly up to 1.9 wt.% to form β-FeTiH and γ-FeTiH2 phases. In this paper, we have discussed the historic background outlining the recent developments on the microstructural modifications, activation kinetics and processing routes of TiFe intermetallic alloys toward the improvement of hydrogenation properties. An in-depth microstructural analysis of TiFe alloys has been presented in terms of crystallography, hydride phase formation and hydrogenation mechanisms. The rate-controlling steps for the mechanisms of (de)hydrogenation processes of TiFe intermetallics have been explained in details. It was found that the rate-controlling steps of the hydriding reaction were dependent on the fraction of β-hydride phase. Intensive research activities were carried out to improve the first hydrogenation kinetics that can be categorized into two groups: alloying and mechanical activation. The mechanisms for improved hydrogenation kinetics in both cases have been explained. Lastly, various fabrication processes to produce TiFe alloys have been presented and correlated with cost-effectiveness and hydrogen-storage capability.

Total and material storage capacities upon five hydrogen release and uptake cycles are 3.56–4.55 and 2.03–3.28 wt % H2, respectively. Inferior hydrogen content to theoretical capacity (material capacity of 5.7 wt % H2) is due to partial dehydrogenation during sample preparation and incomplete decomposition of LiBH4 as well as the formation of thermally stable Li2B12H12 upon cycling. Two-step dehydrogenation of MgH2 and LiBH4 to produce Mg and MgB2+LiH, respectively is found at all positions in the tank. For rehydrogenation, reversibility of MgH2 and LiBH4 proceeds via different reaction mechanisms.

To complete the family of MN2H3BH3, we focused on cesium hydrazinidoborane CsN2H3BH3 (CsHB). It has been synthesized by reaction of cesium with hydrazine borane (N2H4BH3) at −20 °C under inert atmosphere, and it has been characterized. A crystalline solid (monoclinic, s.g. P21 (No. 4)) has been obtained. Its potential for hydrogen storage has been studied by combining different techniques. It was found that, under heating at constant heating rate (5 °C min−1) or at constant temperature (e.g. 120 °C), CsHB decomposes rather than it dehydrogenates. It releases several unwanted gaseous products (e.g. NH3, B2H6) together with H2, and transforms into a residue that poses safety issues because of shock-sensitivity and reactivity towards O2/H2O. Though the destabilization brought by Cs+ onto the anion [N2H3BH3]− has been confirmed, the effect is not efficient enough to avoid the aforementioned drawbacks.

The aim of the hydrogen storage technologies is thus to reduce the volume that hydrogen occupies in its thermodynamically stable state under conditions close to ambient salt. Recent work on hydrogen storage is mainly based on the use of metal hydrides. These metal hydrides have a high capacity for the hydrogen storage in the operating conditions. The effecting parameters on the performance of such a metal-hydrogen reactor are its design and configuration. In this case, there are a number of problems that need to be considered in designing a reactor. Among these parameters are the reactor configuration, the thermal and the mechanical strength, the kinetics of hydrogen storage and the security. Our study is concentrated on the problem of the thermal and the mechanical strength while focusing on the nature of the metal makes the reactor. In this work, the experimental studies of the hydrogen absorption phenomenon in different reactors, based on metal hydrides, were evaluated. The characteristics of the reaction kinetics in three different reactors using the same measurement conditions were compared. A numerical model describing the reaction kinetic of the H2 absorption by LaNi5 alloy validates the results were obtained. Of these results, it is found that the rate constant varies from one reactor to another. Moreover, the activation energy of the absorption kinetics were identified. © 2017","Activation energy; Hydrogen storage; Kinetics; LaNi<sub>5</sub>; Metal-hydride; Solid state reactions","Activation energy; Binary alloys; Chemical activation; Enzyme kinetics; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Kinetics; Lanthanum alloys; Metals; Nickel alloys; Rate constants; Reaction kinetics; Solid state reactions; Absorption kinetics; Hydrogen storage technologies; LaNi5; Measurement conditions; Metal hydrides; Operating condition; Reactor configuration; Thermodynamically stable; Hydrogen storage"

Developments in novel, sustainable technologies towards a CO2-free society are needed and the exploration of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) as well as solid-state hydrogen storage applications based on metal hydrides can provide solutions for such technologies. However, there are still many technical challenges for both hydrogen storage material and ASSBs related to designing low-cost materials with low-environmental impact. The current materials considered for all-solid-state batteries should have high conductivities for Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+, while Al3+-based compounds are often marginalised due to the lack of suitable electrode and electrolyte materials. In hydrogen storage materials, the sluggish kinetic behaviour of solid-state hydride materials is one of the key constraints that limit their practical uses. Therefore, it is necessary to overcome the kinetic issues of hydride materials before discussing and considering them on the system level.

Magnesium based materials are being studies for solid-state hydrogen storage due to their advantages of high volumetric and gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity. However, unfavorable thermodynamic and kinetic barriers hinder its practical application. In this work, we presented that kinetics of Mg-based composites were significantly improved during high energy ball milling in presence of various types of carbon, including plasma carbon produced by plasma-reforming of hydrocarbons, activated carbon, and carbon nanotubes. The improvement of the kinetics and de-/re-hydrogenation performance of MgH2 and TiC-catalysed MgH2 by introduction of carbon are strongly dependent on the milling time, amount of carbon and carbon structure. The lowest dehydrogenation temperature was observed at 180 °C by the plasma carbon–modified MgH2/TiC. We found that nanoconfinement of carbon structures stabilised Mg-based nanocomposites and hinders the nanoparticles growth and agglomeration. Plasma carbon was found to show better effects than the other two carbon structures because the plasma carbon contained both few layer graphene sheets that served as an active dispersion matrix and amorphous activated carbons that promoted the spill-over effect of TiC catalysed MgH2.

The Mg–Mg2Ni-carbon hybrid can be synthesized by accumulative roll bonding (ARB), which is amenable to ‘scaled-up’ synthesis. In spite of the ‘bulk’ nature of the samples synthesized, they display fast kinetics of absorption and desorption of hydrogen. In the current work, we try to comprehend the basis for the same in terms of the activation energy of the underlying processes involved; via desorption curves (wt.% H - time curves) in a Sievert's apparatus and differential scanning calorimetry (heat evolved - T plots). Analysis invoking the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami model and Kissinger plots show that the significantly reduced activation energy for the dehydrogenation process in the hybrid is responsible for the rapid kinetics. It is evinced that admixing the additives with Mg, coupled with fine scale microstructure rich in interfaces is responsible for the fast kinetics.

In the present work, we have systematically studied four cages of T8, T10, and T12 (D2d and D6h) for hydrogen storage including adsorption and encapsulation of hydrogen molecules. We find that silsesquioxane cages have up to about 4150 m2/g specific surface area (SSA) and 7.81 wt % for hydrogen storage. These calculated values are comparable to the highest hydrogen storage values of metal-organic frameworks, porous polymer networks, and covalent organic frameworks. In addition, we use the quasi-dynamic method to study the encapsulation of hydrogen molecules into these cages because of the timescale limitation of ab initio molecular dynamics. Thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy and Gibbs free energy at different temperatures are calculated during the insertion processes.

Nonetheless, their practical use is obstructed by several factors, including deterioration and slow hydrogen absorption/desorption kinetics resulting from the surface chemical action of gas impurities. Lately, common strategies, such as spark plasma sintering, mechanical alloying, melt spinning, surface modification and alloying with other elements have been exploited, in order to overcome kinetic barriers. Through these techniques, improvements in hydriding kinetics has been achieved, however, it is still far from that required in practical application. In this review, we provide a critical overview on the effect of mechanical alloying of various metal hydrides (MHs), ranging from binary hydrides (CaH2, MgH2, etc) to ternary hydrides (examples being Ti-Mn-N and Ca-La-Mg-based systems), that are used in solid-state hydrogen storage, while we also deliver comparative study on how the aforementioned alloy preparation techniques affect H2 absorption/desorption kinetics of different MHs. Comparisons have been made on the resultant material phases attained by mechanical alloying with those of melt spinning and spark plasma sintering techniques. The reaction mechanism, surface modification techniques and hydrogen storage properties of these various MHs were discussed in detail. We also discussed the remaining challenges and proposed some suggestions to the emerging research of MHs. Based on the findings obtained in this review, the combination of two or more compatible techniques, e.g., synthesis of metal alloy materials through mechanical alloying followed by surface modification (metal deposition, metal-metal co-deposition or fluorination), may provide better hydriding kinetics. © 2020 by the authors.

The end-product obtained after 50 h of milling was consolidated into bulk buttons, using a hot-pressing technique at 350 °C. The results have shown that this consolidation step, followed by the repetitive pressing at ambient temperature did not affect the nanocrystalline characteristics of pressed powders. Recycling pressing demonstrated beneficial effects of plastic deformation and lattice imperfections on Mg, leading to its enhanced hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics and cycle-life-time performance compared with untreated samples. The results elucidated that spherical, hard, nanopowder of MG-Zr2Pd were forced to penetrate the Mg/MgH2 matrix to create micro/nanopore structures upon pressing for 50 cycles. These ultrafine spherical metallic glassy particles (∼400 nm in diameter) acted as a micro-milling media for reducing the particle size of MgH2 powders into submicron particles. In addition, they played a vital role as grain growth inhibitors to prevent the undesired growth of Mg grains upon the application of a moderate temperature in the range of 50 °C to 350 °C.

More importantly, the system revealed excellent dehydrogenation kinetics at 225 °C as implied by the limited time needed to release 6.1 wt% H2 in 10 min.

The adoption of hydrogen as an energy source has been restricted to low levels due to the complications associated with its viable storage and usage. Existing technologies, such as storage of hydrogen in compressed and liquefied forms are not adequate to meet the broad on-board applications. The gravimetric energy density (120 MJ/kg) of hydrogen is three times higher than that of gasoline products, so solid-state hydrogen storage is advantageous. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and graphene are solid adsorbents majorly employed for efficient H2 storage. The prominent features of MOFs such as permanent porosity, structural rigidity, and surface area are attractive and ideal for hydrogen storage. In addition, nanostructured carbon materials (MWCNTs and graphene) and their composites have demonstrated significant hydrogen storage capacities. Some important parameters for the success of the hydrogen economy include high storage density, adsorption/desorption temperature and cycling time. Cryo-hydrogen storage was achieved in MOFs and their composites with carbon structures, but storage at ambient temperature and acceptable pressures is a major hurdle. This review discusses various strategies and mechanisms in the design of adsorbents explored to improve H2 storage capacities and afford opportunities to develop new sustainable hydrogen technologies to meet energy targets. © 2018 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences","Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen storage; Metal-organic frameworks; MWCNTs/Graphene; Nanocomposites; Spillover","Fossil fuels; Graphene; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen fuels; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Nanocomposites; Organometallics; Proven reserves; Gravimetric energy densities; Hydrogen storage capacities; Hydrogen technologies; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); MWCNTs/Graphene; Nanostructured carbon materials; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Spillover; Hydrogen storage"

The alloy with composition Ti2FeV was prepared by arc melting method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis studies confirmed formation of solid solution phase with uniform composition and BCC structure. SEM studies revealed the formation of irregular shaped particles with size in the range of few microns up on hydrogenation of the parent alloy. The alloy shows maximum hydrogen storage capacity of 3.41 wt.% at 20 bar and 303 K and the thermodynamic parameters established near room temperature suitability of the alloy for solid state hydrogen storage applications. Hydrogenation kinetics is found to be quite fast and detailed kinetic analysis were done to underscore the hydrogenation mechanism. Activation energy during the initial stage of hydrogenation is found to be 30.8 kJ/mol. The value decreases to 14.4 kJ/mol for extended duration of hydrogenation, and this is explained based on difference in rate determining steps existing at different time scales.

Typical layer morphology is observed for the prepared (Ti0.5V0.5)3C2, which exhibits a better catalytic activity than that of Ti3C2. The addition of 10 wt% (Ti0.5V0.5)3C2 remarkably reduces the dehydrogenation onset temperature of MgH2 by 70 °C, from 266 to 196 °C. At 250 °C, approximately 5.0 wt% H2 is released from the 10 wt% (Ti0.5V0.5)3C2-containing MgH2 within 20 min. The dehydrogenated sample rapidly absorbs 4.8 wt% H2 within 5 s at 120 °C; these hydrogenation kinetics are much more superior even to the well-studied Nb2O5 catalyst. The apparent activation energy is calculated to be 77.3 kJ/mol for the MgH2-10 wt% (Ti0.5V0.5)3C2 sample, which is only around half of that of the pristine MgH2 (153.8 kJ/mol). This is responsible for the remarkably reduced dehydrogenation operating temperature.

Surface modification is achieved through engineering lanthanum (La)- or nickel (Ni)-rich surface layers with enhanced cyclic stability in an H2/O2 mixture. The formation of a Ni-rich surface layer does not improve the cycling stability in H2/O2 mixtures. Mischmetal (Mm, a mixture of La and Ce) agglomerates are observed within the bulk and surface of the alloy when small amounts of this material are added during arc melting synthesis. These agglomerates provide hydrogen-transparent diffusion pathways into the bulk of the V-Ti-Cr-Fe hydrogen storage alloy when the remaining oxidized surface is already nontransparent for hydrogen. Thus, the cycling stability of the alloy is improved in an O2-containing hydrogen environment as compared to the same alloy without addition of Mm.

However, the predicted reversible hydrogen sorption properties at moderate temperatures have not been reached due to sluggish hydrogen sorption kinetics. Hydrogen (H) → deuterium (D) exchange experiments can contribute to the understanding of the stability of the BH4                             - anion. Pure γ-Mg(BH4)2, ball milled Mg(BH4)2 and composites with the additives nickel triboride (Ni3B) and diniobium pentaoxide (Nb2O5) have been investigated. In situ Raman analysis demonstrated that in pure γ-Mg(BH4)2 the isotopic exchange reaction during continuous heating started at ∼80 °C, while the ball milled sample did not show any exchange at 3 bar D2. However, during ex situ exchange reactions investigated by infrared (IR) and thermogravimetric (TG) analyses a comparable H → D exchange during long exposures (23 h) to deuterium atmosphere was observed for as received, ball milled and γ-Mg(BH4)2 + Nb2O5, while the Ni3B additive hindered isotopic exchange. The specific surface areas (SSA) were shown to be very different for as received γ-Mg(BH4)2, BET area = 900 m2 g-1, and ball milled Mg(BH4)2, BET area = 30 m2 g-1, respectively, and this explains why no gas-solid H(D) diffusion was observed for the ball milled (amorphous) Mg(BH4)2 during the short time frames of in situ Raman measurements. The heat treated ball milled sample partially regained the porous γ-Mg(BH4)2 structure (BET area = 560 m2 g-1). This in combination with the long reaction times allowing for the reaction to approach equilibrium explains the observed gas-solid H(D) diffusion during long exposure. We have also demonstrated that a small amount of D can be substituted in both high surface area and low surface area samples at room temperature proving that the B-H bonds in Mg(BH4)2 can be challenged at these mild conditions. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Additives; Ball milling; Chemical reactions; Deuterium; Hydrogen storage; Nickel compounds; Niobium oxide; Continuous heating; Hydrogen sorption kinetics; Isotopic exchange reactions; Magnesium borohydride; Moderate temperature; Reversible hydrogen sorptions; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Specific surface area (SSA); Magnesium compounds"

It has become an important and strategic issue, to ensure the energetic sufficiency of humanity. Indeed, hydrogen storage in solids has been proved and revealed as clean and efficient energy storage. Moreover, it can be thought as a seriously considered solution to enable renewable energy to be a part of our quotidian life. To achieve storing hydrogen in solid form, the present study aimed to concepts and simulates a solid-state hydrogen storage reactor (tank). An investigation of the parameters influencing the hydrogen storage performance is carried out. Meanwhile, to understand the physical phenomenon taking place during the storage of hydrogen, a 2D numerical modelling for a metal hydrides-based in hydrogen reactor is presented. A strong coupling between energy balance, kinetic law, as well as a mass momentum balance at sorbent bed temperature under a non-uniform pressure was resolved based on finite element method. The temporal evolutions of pressure, the raising temperature in the bed during the hydriding process as well as the impact of the hydrogen supply pressure within the tank are analysed and validated by comparison with the experimental work in literature, a good agreement is obtained.

Three-dimensional flower-like TiO2@C and TiO2 were synthesized as the catalyst for MgH2 system and great catalytic activities are acquired in the hydrogen sorption properties. Experiments also show that the flower-like TiO2@C is superior to flower-like TiO2 in improving the hydrogen storage properties of MgH2. The hydrogen desorption onset and peak temperatures of flower-like TiO2 doped MgH2 is reduced to 199.2 °C and 245.4 °C, while the primitive MgH2 starts to release hydrogen at 294.6 °C and the rapid dehydrogenation temperature is even as high as 362.6 °C. The onset and peak temperatures of flower-like TiO2@C doped MgH2 are further reduced to 180.3 °C and 233.0 °C. The flower-like TiO2@C doped MgH2 composite can release 6.0 wt% hydrogen at 250 °C within 7 min, and 4.86 wt% hydrogen at 225 °C within 60 min, while flower-like TiO2 doped MgH2 can release 6.0 wt% hydrogen at 250 °C within 8 min, and 3.89 wt% hydrogen at 225 °C within 60 min. Hydrogen absorption kinetics is also improved dramatically. Moreover, compared with primitive MgH2 and the flower-like TiO2 doped MgH2, the activation energy of flower-like TiO2@C doped MgH2 is significantly decreased to 67.10 kJ/mol. All the improvement of hydrogen sorption properties can be ascribed to the flower-like structure and the two-phase coexistence of TiO2 and amorphous carbon. Such phase composition and unique structure are proved to be the critical factor to improve the hydrogen sorption properties of MgH2, which can be considered as the new prospect for improving the kinetics of light-metal hydrogen storage materials. © 2019","Catalytic effects; Flower-like structure; Hydrogen storage; Magnesium hydride; TiO<sub>2</sub>","Activation energy; Amorphous carbon; Catalyst activity; Hydrides; Kinetics; Magnesium compounds; Sorption; Temperature; Titanium dioxide; C-doped; Catalytic effects; Flower-like structures; Hydrogen sorption; Onset temperature; Peak temperatures; Performance; Potential materials; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Sorption properties; Hydrogen storage"

Significant reduction of onset and main dehydrogenation temperatures of MgH2 (ΔT = 243 and 158 °C, respectively) are achieved by doping with 5–10 wt % of NbF5, ACNF-TiF4 and ACNF-NbF5.

Due to its high gravimetric and volumetric densities, magnesium is a material of great potential for solid-state hydrogen storage. However, the slow hydrogen diffusion kinetics and the deleterious blocking effect in magnesium have hampered its practical applications. Here, we demonstrate fast lateral hydrogen diffusion in quasifree magnesium films without the blocking effect. Massive concomitant lattice expansion leads to the formation of remarkable self-organized finger patterns extending over tens of micrometers. Detailed visualization of diffusion fronts reveals that the fingers in these patterns follow locally the direction of hydrogen diffusion. Thus, the streamlines of the diffusion process are self-recorded by means of the finger pattern. By inclusion of fast hydrogen diffusion objects or local gaps, the resulting streamlines exhibit a clear analogy to optical rays in geometric optics. The possibility to spatially manipulate hydrogen diffusion opens an avenue to build advanced hydrogen storage systems, cloaking and active plasmonic devices, as well as prototype systems for computational models. © 2018 American Physical Society.","","Diffusion; Hydrides; Lithium batteries; Magnesium; Plasmonics; Plasmons; Computational model; Diffusion process; Hydrogen diffusion; Hydrogen storage system; Lattice expansion; Prototype system; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Volumetric density; Hydrogen storage"

Through this research, we found the correlation between the reactivity with ammonia and the Pauling electronegativity of neutral atoms according to different systems. Metal hydrides with small electronegativity value of the neutral atom of the cations can react with ammonia to form metal amides, which can be used as hydrogen storage material.

Studies on the hydrogen storage properties of materials generally involve their phase structures, microstructures, thermal/structural stability, chemical compositions and bonding, which can be studied by ex situ experimental technologies. However, the experimental results obtained from ex situ measurements may be contaminated during sample handling, and some important intermediate phases are too metastable/unstable to be detected. To overcome the drawbacks, in situ studies are carried out, leading to a large number of unprecedented advantages. In this review, recent advances regarding in situ measurement technologies for solid-state hydrogen storage materials are summarized, mainly focusing on metal hydrides and complex hydrides. The working principles together with the devices used for the in situ methods are briefly introduced. Afterwards, both the classic and recent advances regarding the in situ measurement technologies for metal hydrides and complex hydrides are comprehensively summarized and reviewed.

Hydrogen has a low density of around 0.0899 kg m−3 at normal temperature, and pressure (~7% of the density of air), which is the main challenge in its real applications.

Successful development of hydrogen economy means innumerable advantages for the environment, energy security, economy, and final users. One major key to wholly develop hydrogen economy is safe, compact, light and cost-efficient hydrogen storage. The conventional gaseous state storage system as pressurized hydrogen gas and liquid state storage system pose safety and cost problems to onboard applications; therefore, they do not satisfy the future goals for a hydrogen economy. Fortunately, solid-state storage systems based on metal hydrides have demonstrated great potentials to store hydrogen in large quantities in a quite secure, compact, and repeatedly reversible manner and thus, becoming increasingly attractive option for hydrogen applications. However, techno-economic feasibility of hydrogen storage systems is yet to be realized as none of the current metal hydrides fulfill all the essential criteria for a practical hydrogen economy, mainly because of low hydrogen storage capacity, sluggish kinetics and unacceptable temperatures of hydrogen absorption/desorption. This article gives a brief review of hydrogen as an ideal sustainable energy carrier for the future economy, its storage as the stumbling block as well as the current position of solid-state hydrogen storage in metal hydrides and makes a recommendation based on the most promising novel discoveries made in the field in recent times which suggests a prospective breakthrough towards a hydrogen economy. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Catalysis; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen storage; Metal hydrides; Nanoconfinement; Nanostructuring","Catalysis; Discovery wells; Energy security; Hydrides; Hydrogen fuels; Metals; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen storage capacities; Metal hydrides; Nano-structuring; Nanoconfinements; Solid state storage systems; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Techno-economic feasibility; Hydrogen storage"

Meanwhile, NaMgH3 possesses an outstanding theoretical thermal storage density of 2881 kJ/kg, which makes it one of the most promising thermal energy storage materials. However, the sluggish dehydrogenation kinetics of NaMgH3 embarrasses further practical application. Doping a nanosize Ti-based catalyst is treated to be one of the most effective methods to settle the poor dehydriding kinetics. In this work, different kinds of TiO2 catalysts, the 5 wt % TiO2 microparticle (MP) (100 nm), TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) (5-10 nm), and TiO2 nanotube (NT) (5-10 nm), were doped into NaMgH3 in the process of ball milling and heat treatment, which in situ formed Na0.46TiO2 significantly promoting the full hydrogen desorption kinetics of NaMgH3. Among all samples, the TiO2 NT-doped sample shows the best performance of which the onset decomposition temperature is reduced to 300 °C, and the first- and second-step decomposition peak temperatures are decreased to 346.3 and 355.8 °C, respectively. The TiO2 NT-doped sample desorbs approximately 3.4 wt % H2 at 350 °C within 10 min, while the pure NaMgH3 sample releases only 0.2 wt % H2 in 10 min. The significant improvement in both two decomposition reactions kinetics of NaMgH3 can be attributed to the tubular morphology of the TiO2 NT and the in situ formation of multivalence Ti species (Na0.46TiO2). These two reasons can change the kinetic models of NaMgH3 from A2 to R2 and further dramatically decrease the activation energies of first- and second-step decomposition reactions of NaMgH3 to 91.7 and 142.1 kJ/mol, respectively.

The several engineering solutions presented in this work try to address the technical challenges in synthesis and application of solid-state hydrogen storage materials, mainly metal hydride based compounds. Moving from the synthesis of samples in lab-scale to the production of industrial sized batches a novel process development is required, including safety approaches (for hazardous powders), and methods to prevent the contamination of sensitive chemicals. The reduction of overall costs has to be addressed as well, considering new sources for raw materials and more cost-efficient catalysts. The properties of the material itself influence the performances of the hydride in a pilot storage tank, but the characteristics of the system itself are crucial to investigate the reaction limiting steps and overcome hindrances. For this, critical experiments using test tanks are needed, learning how to avoid issues as material segregation or temperature gradients, and optimizing the design in the aspects of geometry, hull material, and test station facilities.

The technological innovation of fuel cells contributes to the attractive prospect of hydrogen energy in vehicles, but the problem of hydrogen filling and hydrogen storage has become one of the obstacles to the development of hydrogen energy cars. The safe and efficient hydrogen storage is crucial for the large-scale application of hydrogen energy. Till now there have been developed three main hydrogen storage methods, which include high-pressure gaseous hydrogen storage, low-temperature liquid hydrogen storage and solid-state hydrogen storage. The gravimetric density of gaseous hydrogen storage system can be promoted by increasing the pressure of hydrogen and the specific strength of container material. However, H2 molecular interaction causes a relatively low volumetric density of gaseous hydrogen storage system, and excessively high hydrogen pressure challenges the safety and heightens design difficulty and cost of hydrogen tanks. The liquid hydrogen storage owns ideal gravimetric and volumetric density, which can be realized by compres-sing and liquefying hydrogen gas. However, liquid hydrogen is particularly prone to volatilize and liquid hydrogen container requires strict storing conditions. In addition, the liquefying process of gaseous hydrogen is uneconomical, as it consumes an energy quantity that constitutes about 40% of the combustion heat release of the stored hydrogen. For the solid-state hydrogen storage, hydrogen is stored in the hydrides in the form of atom or ion. Hence, the solid-state hydrogen storage obtains an impressively high volumetric density and enjoys greater security because the hydrogen storage materials absorb/desorb hydrogen at mild conditions. But the gravimetric density of hydrogen storage materials is comparatively low. The high-pressure hybrid hydrogen storage vessel, which combines the advantages of gaseous and solid-state hydrogen storage methods, offers a feasible path to safe and high-density hydrogen storage. The volumetric density of high-pressure hydrogen tank can be effectively enhanced by the hydrogen storage materials, resulting in lower operating pressure, smaller volume, and higher safety. The performance promotion of the high-pressure hybrid hydrogen storage vessels depends upon the development of materials with excellent hydrogen sorption performances under high hydrogen pressure. The AB2 type ZrFe2-based and TiCr2 based alloys are the currently prevailing high-pressure hydrogen storage materials. Though researchers mainly concentrate on and have achieved the regulation of storage capacity, absorption/desorption pressure plateau and kinetics through the alloying trials which partially substitute elements with various atomic radius and electronic structures for either A-site or B-site, the gravimetric densities of ZrFe2-based and TiCr2-based alloys are still unsatisfactory. NaAlH4 and AlH3 display considerable potential as candidate storage materials owing to their intrinsically high storage density. For NaAlH4, sufficient works have preliminarily confirmed the effectiveness of nanosizing and catalyst-doping toward dehydrogenation temperature reduction and cyclic stability enhancement. And the yield of AlH3 along with its crystallinity can likely be enhanced by adopting ball milling or improving the solvent. This review starts with a brief introduction of how the high-pressure hybrid hydrogen storage vessel works and a summary of the performance requirements of the hydrogen storage materials. It then provides detailed discussion and description upon the structure, characteristics and research status quo with respect to the above-mentioned two species of high-pressure hydrogen storage materials, i.e.hydrogen storage alloys (ZrFe2, TiCr2) and aluminum based complex hydrides (NaAlH4, AlH3). © 2019, Materials Review Magazine.

During the search process for novel materials for storing hydrogen, research interests in the past few decades have been intensively focused on light metal borohydrides and amides as two representative chemical complex hydrides with high hydrogen capacities. Recently, a large number of studies have reported new borohydride/amide combined systems that expand the scope of hydrogen-storage materials. Here, we review the interaction between light metal borohydrides and amides for storing hydrogen, with a special emphasis on the synthetic strategies and structural, physical, and chemical properties, which reveal a correlation between the composition, structure, and dehydrogenation properties and also provide general principles to the design of new combined systems with tailored functionality. This review also demonstrates the current progress on the dehydrogenation kinetic improvement of borohydride/amide combined systems. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Amides; Dehydrogenation; Hydrogen; Light metals; Storage (materials); Chemical complexes; Dehydrogenation kinetics; Dehydrogenation properties; Hydrogen capacities; Hydrogen storage system; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Structure and properties; Synthetic strategies; Hydrogen storage"

The grain (crystallite) size of LiNH2 and MgH2 decreases rapidly with increasing QTR up to approximately 150-200 kJ/g and subsequently more or less saturates at the value of 10-20 nm. For the injected energy QTR ≈ 250-350 kJ/g the specific surface area (SSA) increases from the initial 2.4 m2/g for powder mixtures before milling to 30-37 m2/g for nanocomposites after milling. After injecting QTR ≈ 550 kJ/g there is a further increase of SSA to 52 m2/g which is over 20-fold increase of SSA from its initial value. That clearly indicates that a profound reduction of particle size has occurred. The hydride phases formed during ball milling with relatively low QTR are identified as a-Mg(NH 2)2 (amorphous magnesium imide) and LiH. The ball milled (LiNH2 + nMgH2) nanocomposite system with n = 0.5-0.9 can effectively desorb about 4-5 wt.% H2 with a reasonable rate at the temperature range close to 200 °C. Within a low temperature range up to ∼250 °C, regardless of the molar ratio n and the injected energy Q TR the thermal desorption of the (LiNH2 + nMgH 2) nanocomposites occurs without any release of ammonia, NH 3. For all molar ratios, n, the hydride nanocomposites are fully reversible at 175 °C under a relatively mild pressure of 50 bar H 2. The quantity of H2 desorbed decreases with increasing molar ratio n, due to increasing fraction of inactive, retained MgH2. However, at 125 °C the dehydrogenation rate is very sluggish and the quantity of released H2 is minimal. At the temperature range lower than ∼250 °C dehydrogenation of ball milled nanocomposites occurs through formation of the Li2Mg(NH)2 hydride phase. The value of the measured dehydrogenation enthalpy change of 46.7 kJ/molH 2 is relatively low and apparently, it is not responsible for sluggish dehydrogenation at 125 °C. The measurements of thermal conductivity for non-milled powders and ball milled nanocomposites show a dramatic reduction of thermal conductivity after ball milling. It seems that this could be a principal factor responsible for such a low dehydrogenation rate at low temperatures. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, its dehydrogenation temperature (∼623 K) is too high for any mobile applications. By addition of 10 mol% of NbF5 into Ca(BH4)2+MgH2, a decrease of the dehydrogenation onset temperature by ∼120 K is observed. In order to understand the reasons behind this desorption temperature decrement two sets of samples [Ca(BH4)2+MgH2 and Ca(BH4)2+MgH2+0.1NbF5] in different hydrogenation states, were prepared. The structural investigation of the above mentioned sets of samples by means of volumetric measurements, anomalous small-angle X-ray scattering (ASAXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is reported here. The XAS results show that after the milling procedure NbB2 is formed and remains stable upon further de/rehydrogenation cycling. The results of Nb ASAXS point to nanometric spherical NbB2 particles distributed in the hydride matrix, with a mean diameter of ∼10 nm. Results from Ca ASAXS indicate Ca-containing nanostructures in the Ca-RHC+0.1NbF5 samples to be ∼50% finer compared to those without additive. Thus, a higher reaction surface area and shorter diffusion paths for the constituents are concluded to be important contributions to the catalytic effect of an NbF5 additive on the hydrogen sorption kinetics of the Ca(BH4)2+MgH2 composite system. © 2014 International Union of Crystallography.","anomalous small-angle X-ray scattering; hydrogen storage; reactive hydride composite; structure analysis; X-ray absorption spectroscopy","Dehydrogenation; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; X ray absorption spectroscopy; Anomalous small-angle x-ray scatterings; Desorption temperatures; Hydrogen sorption kinetics; Hydrogen storage capacities; Hydrogen storage materials; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Structural investigation; Structure analysis; Calcium"

Those observations were made using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pressure-composition-temperature (PCT) techniques. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements suggest that the additives functioned as catalysts during the reactions. The comparison of the characteristics of different additives suggested that the hydrogen equilibrium pressures of those additives themselves have a significant bearing on their effects on the kinetic behaviors of MgH2.

Herein the structural, energetic and electronic properties of α-MSiH3 silanides (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) and MSi Zintl phases are systematically investigated for the first time by using first-principles calculations method based on density functional theory. The structural parameters of α-MSiH3 and MSi including lattice constants and atomic positions are determined through geometry optimization. The obtained results are close to the experimental data analysed from X-ray and neutron powder diffraction. The calculations of formation enthalpy show that α-KSiH3, α-RbSiH3 and α-CsSiH3 silanides are easier to be synthetized relative to α-LiSiH3 and α-NaSiH3, which interprets well the lower thermostabilities of experimental α-LiSiH3 and α-NaSiH3. Nevertheless, LiSi, KSi and CsSi phases are easier to be formed relative to NaSi and RbSi. The calculations of hydrogen desorption enthalpy reveal that the dehydrogenation abilities of α-MSiH3 silanides along the decomposition path of α-MSiH3→MSi + H2 are gradually enhanced in the order of α-CsSiH3, α-RbSiH3, α-KSiH3, α-NaSiH3 and α-LiSiH3, which may be originated from their decreasing thermostabilities. From a comprehensive point of view including hydrogen storage capacity, thermostability and dehydrogenation ability, α-KSiH3 (∼4.29 wt%) is identified as the most promising alkali metal silanide for reversible hydrogen storage. Analysis of electronic structures indicates that a significant charge transfer leads to positively charged M ions and negatively charged SiH3 complex, which constitutes the ionic bonding between them. The bonding within SiH3 complex not only involves the covalent hybridization between Si (3s) (3p) and H (1s) orbitals, but also exhibits some ionic bond characteristics due to the partial charge transfer from Si to H. The covalent bonding interactions between H and Si atoms within SiH3 mainly dominate the thermostabilities and dehydrogenation properties of α-MSiH3 silanides. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Alkali metal silanides; Electronic structure; First-principles calculations; Formation enthalpy; Hydrogen desorption enthalpy; Hydrogen storage materials","Calculations; Cesium compounds; Charge transfer; Chemical bonds; Crystal atomic structure; Dehydrogenation; Density functional theory; Desorption; Digital storage; Electronic properties; Electronic structure; Enthalpy; Hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Lattice constants; Lithium compounds; Metals; Rubidium compounds; Silicon; Sodium compounds; Dehydrogenation properties; Energetic and electronic properties; First-principles calculation; Formation enthalpy; Hydrogen desorption; Hydrogen storage capacities; Partial charge transfer; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Potassium compounds"

The as-prepared sample showed a nano Ni decorated LiBH4 clusters covered by the thin film of activated carbon, which helped reduce the doping amount of Ni catalyst and improve the reversibility of LiBH4.

We put particular focus on how, conceptually, plasmonic resonances can be used to study metal-hydrogen interactions at the nanoscale, both at the ensemble and at the single-nanoparticle level. Such efforts are motivated by a fundamental interest in understanding the role of nanosizing on metal hydride formation processes in the quest to develop efficient solid-state hydrogen storage materials with fast response times, reasonable thermodynamics, and acceptable long-term stability. Therefore, a brief introduction to the thermodynamics of metal hydride formation is also given. However, plasmonic hydrogen sensors not only are of academic interest as research tool in materials science but also are predicted to find more practical use as all-optical gas detectors in industrial and medical applications, as well as in a future hydrogen economy, where hydrogen is used as a carbon free energy carrier. Therefore, the wide range of different plasmonic hydrogen sensor designs already available is reviewed together with theoretical efforts to understand their fundamentals and optimize their performance in terms of sensitivity. In this context, we also highlight important challenges to be addressed in the future to take plasmonic hydrogen sensors from the laboratory to real applications in devices, including poisoning/deactivation of the active materials, sensor lifetime, and cross-sensitivity toward other gas species. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","hydrogen; localized surface plasmon resonance; metal hydride; nanoparticles; nanowires; palladium; sensing; sensors; surface plasmon resonance","Free energy; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen storage; Industrial research; Medical applications; Metal nanoparticles; Metals; Nanoparticles; Nanostructured materials; Nanowires; Oil field equipment; Palladium; Plasmonic nanoparticles; Plasmons; Resonance; Sensors; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Long term stability; Metal hydrides; Nanostructured metals; Plasmonic resonances; sensing; Single nanoparticle; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Surface plasmon resonance"

The milling energy in a magneto-mill is estimated by a semi-empirical method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) measurements show that for the molar ratios n < 1.0 three new phases such as LiH, amorphous Mg(NH2)2 (a-Mg(NH2)2) and Li 2Mg(NH)2 are formed during ball milling depending on the injected quantity of milling energy. Hydrogen is not released during milling when the LiH and a-Mg(NH2)2 hydrides are being formed whereas the formation of the Li2Mg(NH)2 hydride phase is always accompanied by a profound release of hydrogen. For the molar ratios n ≥ 1.0, at a low level of injected milling energy, the hydride phases formed are LiH and a-Mg(NH2)2. The latter reacts with MgH 2 during further milling to form the new phase MgNH whose formation is also accompanied by a profound release of hydrogen.

The hydrogen energy seems to be a promising candidate. To explore the possibility of achieving a solid-state high-capacity storage of hydrogen for onboard applications, we have performed first-principles density functional theoretical calculations of hydrogen storage properties of beryllium oxide clusters (BeO)n (n = 2-8). We observed that a polar BeO bond is responsible for H2 adsorption. The problem of cohesion of beryllium atoms does not arise, as they are an integral part of BeO clusters. The (BeO)n (n = 2-8) adsorbs 8-12 H2 molecules with an adsorption energy in the desirable range of reversible hydrogen storage. The gravimetric density of H2 adsorbed on BeO clusters meets the ultimate 7.5 wt % limit, recommended for onboard practical applications.

It is known that particle size can have a strong impact on hydrogen dynamics and sorption characteristics, but more detailed insight has been hampered by the great challenge to prepare small and well-defined particles and study their hydrogen storage properties upon cycling. The preparation of MgH2 nanoparticles supported on high surface area carbon aerogels with pore sizes varying from 6-20 nm is reported. Two distinctly different MgH2 particle populations are observed: X-ray diffraction invisible nanoparticles with sizes below 20 nm, and larger, crystalline, MgH2 particles. They release hydrogen at temperatures 140 °C lower than bulk MgH2. The size-dependent hydrogen kinetics is for the first time corroborated by intrinsic hydrogen dynamics data obtained by solid state 1H NMR. Fast cycling is possible (80% of the capacity absorbed within 15 min at 18 bar and 300 °C), without a change in the hydrogen sorption properties, showing that the growth of the nanoparticles is effectively prevented by the carbon support. A clear correlation is found between the hydrogen desorption temperature and the size of the MgH2 nanoparticles. This illustrates the potential of the use of supported nanoparticles for fast, reversible, and stable hydrogen cycling. Supported MgH2 nanoparticles on carbon with different sizes are synthesized and show faster hydrogen mobility and sorption kinetics. Nanoparticles with sizes below 20 nm have a significant lower hydrogen release temperature and the mobility is three orders of magnitude faster compared to micrometer sized MgH2.

This tunneling pathway gives rise to three barrier heights of 0.54eV, 0.47eV, and 0.7eV.

Till date, no reversible materials are currently known that posses all these attributes. Experimentally, testing the hydrogen storage capacity of a new material not only requires synthesis of a material but also the high precision equipments. The proposed material should also satisfy the target set by the US Department of Energy (DOE). If not, another material has to be synthesized. Theoretical H2 storage properties of a material can be evaluated precisely, and this may provide the mechanism to experimentalists for synthesizing such materials. Recent high performance computational techniques help us to predict the theoretical hydrogen uptake capacity of a material and provide information about its structure, stability and kinetics. Owing to their high uptake capacity at low temperature, structure stability, and excellent reversibility kinetics, organometallic nanostructures have attracted considerable attention as potential solid- state hydrogen storage materials. Here, the results from quantum chemical calculations on adsorption of dihydrogens on various organometallic complexes have been presented. Potential materials that were suited for storage of hydrogen in molecular form are particularly considered. The gravimetric H2 capacity of Scandium-decorated ethylene complex (14 wt%) is found to be well above the target specified by US DOE (5.5 wt% by 2015). Its cation adsorbs one additional molecule than the neutral thereby showing higher gravimetric H2 uptake by about 2 wt% than the neutral. Calculated averaged gain in energy of the complex favored for fast hydrogen adsorption and desorption kinetics. As found from many-body analysis technique, the H2 molecules interact strongly with the cation of C2H4:Sc than the neutral indicating an increase in metal bond strength. In case of Ti:C2H4 organometallic compound, it is found that the ionization process greatly improves its uptake capacity. The predicted gravimetric hydrogen uptake capacity of Ti:C2H4 (11.7 wt%) is in excellent agreement with the experimental value (12 wt%) reported earlier. Average Gibbs free energy correction was found to be as large as 0.45 eV and 0.44 eV for neutral and cation complexes, respectively. The Density Functional Theory (DFT) functionals as well as basis sets affect the averaged H2 adsorption energy with Gibbs free energy correction. The theoretical calculation of Equilibrium Isotope Effect (EIE) was also described. The vibrational frequencies of Ti:C2H4(nH2) and Ti:C2H4(nD2) for different 'n' are used to evaluate the EIE. The calculated EIE of 0.66 (for n=5) is also in excellent agreement with the experimental findings. Similar results were found in case of V:C2H4 complex. Hydrogen uptake capacity of V-capped and V-inserted V:C3H3 complexes was predicted and compared with other organometallic complexes containing single V atom decorated on different CnHn (n > 3) ring templates. The H2 uptake capacity of V:C3H3 organometallic compound is higher than other V-decorated CnHn (n > 3) ring templates reported earlier. The H2 adsorption on the V:C3H3 complex was found to be energetically favorable at finite temperature. The predicted hydrogen uptake capacity of the above systems was confirmed by the ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In order to design an appropriate prototype reactor, model equations for the rate of hydrogen sorption reactions are required. Therefore in the present study, several material properties, like bulk density and thermodynamic data, are measured. Furthermore, isothermal absorption and desorption experiments are performed in a temperature and pressure range that is in the focus of the coupling system. Using experimental data, two-step model equations have been fitted for the hydrogen absorption and desorption reactions.

We report a new strategy that is illustrated for the formation of magnesium boron hydrides, relevant compounds for instance for reversible solid state hydrogen storage. We started with small (5-10 nm) MgH2 nanoparticles inside the ∼10 nm pores of a carbon scaffold, and larger MgH2 crystallites on the exterior surface of the scaffold. The large difference in reactivity between the two types of MgH2 is used to selective react the small MgH2 particles inside the pores with B2H6 to form magnesium boron hydrides under mild conditions. In this way pore-confined magnesium boron hydrides are formed with MgB12H12 as the major phase. Hydrogen release from the confined magnesium boron hydrides starts just above the synthesis temperature of 120 °C. The addition of Ni brings about the reaction to proceed readily at temperatures as low as 30 °C. Furthermore, by Ni addition and tuning the synthesis temperature, the product distribution can be steered toward Mg(BH4)2 and other magnesium boron hydrides. This shows the suitability of our method to selectively form pore-confined complex metal hydrides, such as MgB12H12 for which no synthesis strategy had been reported until now. This strategy might also be relevant for other novel energy storage and conversion materials, which are difficult to nanostructure in a controlled manner by conventional methods. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","","Boron; Chemical elements; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Magnesium; Nanoparticles; Nickel; Scaffolds; Storage (materials); Complex metal hydrides; Confined synthesis; Conventional methods; Energy storage and conversions; Product distributions; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Synthesis strategy; Synthesis temperatures; Synthesis (chemical)"

By calcination, SAS-processed magnesium acetate was converted into magnesium oxide, preserving the morphology of particles. By hydrogenation, the acetate was converted into magnesium hydride, a solid-state hydrogen storage metal hydride.

Simultaneous thermogravimetry and mass spectroscopy (TG-MS) reveal that the nanoconfined LiBH4 starts to desorb hydrogen already at 200 °C with the main release at 310 °C. A partial rehydrogenation at moderate conditions (100 bar and 300 °C) is demonstrated.

In atomistic simulations, the diffusion energy barriers are usually calculated using molecular statics simulations where a nudged elastic band method is used to constrain a path connecting the two end points of an atomic jump. This approach requires prior knowledge of the ""end points"". For alloy and defective systems, the number of possible atomic jumps with respect to local atomic configurations is tremendous. Even when these jumps can be exhaustively studied, it is still unclear how they can be combined to give an overall diffusion behavior seen in experiments. Here we describe the use of molecular dynamics simulations to determine the overall diffusion energy barrier from the Arrhenius equation. This method does not require information about atomic jumps, and it has additional advantages, such as the ability to incorporate finite temperature effects and to determine the pre-exponential factor. As a test case for a generic method, we focus on hydrogen diffusion in bulk aluminum. We find that the challenge of this method is the statistical variation of the results. However, highly converged energy barriers can be achieved by an appropriate set of temperatures, output time intervals (for tracking hydrogen positions), and a long total simulation time. Our results help elucidate the inconsistencies of the experimental diffusion data published in the literature.

LiYb(BH 4)4-xClx takes a primitive tetragonal structure with x = 1.0, a = 6.1729(3) Å and c = 12.4155(10) Å in the space group P42c (no. 112), α-Yb(BH4)3 a primitive cubic structure with a = 10.70715(15) Å in the space group Pa3 (no. 205), and β-Yb(BH4)3 a primitive cubic structure with a = 5.44223(3) Å in the space group Pm3m (no. 221). Thermal decomposition properties of the materials have been investigated by in situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction, thermo gravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry and temperature programmed desorption. The decomposition product, Yb(BH4)2-xClx, adopting a primitive tetragonal structure with space group P4 (no. 81) was formed after release of diborane gas, and x increases with increasing temperature. A deuterated sample of this compound was synthesized for powder neutron diffraction. Rietveld refinement gave x = 0.76, a = 6.74763(2) Å and c = 4.28368(2) Å. Another polymorph of Yb(BH4)2-xClx was synthesized, which adopts a primitive orthorhombic structure with space group Pbca (no. 61), where x = 0.3, a = 13.20997(20) Å, b = 8.26829(12) Å and c = 7.44532(11) Å. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.","","Chlorine compounds; Decomposition; Hydrogen storage; Materials properties; Powder metals; Rietveld refinement; Temperature programmed desorption; X ray diffraction; Decomposition property; Increasing temperatures; Mechanochemical synthesis; Orthorhombic structures; Powder neutron diffraction; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Structures and properties; Synchrotron powder diffraction; Ytterbium"

However, the lack of efficient storage materials has thus far critically limited the widespread adoption of hydrogen, and to overcome this limitation, a promising solid-state storage method is needed. Attractive lightweight metal-based materials for solid-state storage are characterized by the capability to reversibly store a large quantity of hydrogen and should meet or exceed the United States Department of Energy (DOE) on-board storage targets. However, the undesirable kinetic performances of metal hydrides as solid-state storage materials have hindered their practical use as hydrogen storage systems. The kinetic performances, which include the rate of hydrogen uptake or release, are among the most critical requirements of a storage system, and these performances can be determined using the hydrogen absorption and desorption rates. Thus, determining the relevant kinetics is required to supply sufficient amounts of hydrogen and to achieve fast refueling in the system. This review summarizes the kinetic performances and the efforts toward enhancing the hydrogen absorption/desorption kinetics of light metal-based materials. © 2016","Alloy; Ball-mill; Catalyst; Nanostructure; Thin film","Alloying; Ball milling; Catalysts; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Kinetics; Nanostructures; Storage (materials); Thin films; Hydrogen absorption; Hydrogen absorption/desorption kinetics; Hydrogen storage system; Lightweight metals; On board storage; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Solid-state storage; United states department of energies; Hydrogen storage"

Daily activities such as cooking, cleaning, working on the computer and commuting to work are more or less dependent on energy. The world's energy demand is continuously increasing over the years due to the ever-increasing growth in the human population as well as economic development. At present, approximately 90% of energy demands are fulfilled by fossil fuels. With the rising demands of energy throughout the globe, it can be expected that the availability of fossil fuels is depleting at an alarming rate since fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy. In addition, fossil fuels are the main contributor of greenhouse gas emissions and therefore, they have a detrimental impact on human health and environment in the long term. Hence, there is a critical need to develop alternative sources of energy in replacement of fossil fuels. Hydrogen fuels have gained much interest among researchers all over the world since they are clean, non-toxic and renewable, making them suitable for use as substitutes for petroleum-derived fuels in vehicular applications. However, the greatest challenge in using hydrogen fuels lies in the development of hydrogen storage systems, especially for on-board applications. Hydrogen fuels can be stored in gaseous, liquid or solid states, and much effort has been made to develop hydrogen storage systems that are safe, cost-effective, environmental-friendly and more importantly, with high energy densities. Current technologies used for hydrogen storage include high-pressure compression at about 70 MPa, liquefaction at cryogenic temperatures (20 K) and absorption into solid state compounds. Among the three types of hydrogen storage technologies, the storage of hydrogen in solid state compounds appears to be the most feasible solution since it is a safer and more convenient method compared to high-pressure compression and liquefaction technologies. In this regard, metal hydrides are potential chemical compounds for solid-state hydrogen storage, and a large number of studies have been carried out to synthesize low-cost metal hydrides with low absorption/desorption temperatures, high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen storage densities, good resistance to oxidation, good reversibility and cyclic ability, fast kinetics and reactivity, and moderate thermodynamic stability. In general, these studies have shown that the absorption/desorption properties of hydrogen can be improved by: (1) the addition of catalysts into the metal hydrides, (2) alloying the metal hydrides, or (3) nanostructuring. This review article is focused on the latest developments of metal hydrides for solid-state hydrogen storage applications, which will be of interest to scientists, researchers, and practitioners in this field. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Chemical hydrides; Complex hydrides; Hydrogen storage; Intermetallic compounds; Metal hydrides; Mg-based hydrides",""

A new measuring cell with flashtransparent windows was constructed which resembles a gas-tight specimen chamber. This device can be easily adapted to other apparatuses based on the flash method. The thermal conductivities of reference materials in inert and ambient conditions were examined in a temperature range from 25 to 275 °C. In general an excellent agreement was found.

A focus on the gravimetric and volumetric storage capacities for different examples from binary, ternary and complex hydrides is presented, with a comparison between thermodynamic prediction and experimental results. MgH2 constitutes one of the most attractive metal hydrides with a reversible capacity of 1480 mA·h·g-1 at a suitable potential (0.5 V vs Li+/Li0) and the lowest electrode polarization (<0.2 V) for conversion materials. Conversion process reaction mechanisms with lithium are subsequently detailed for MgH2, TiH2, complex hydrides Mg2MHx and other Mg-based hydrides. The reversible conversion reaction mechanism of MgH2, which is lithium-controlled, can be extended to others hydrides as: MHx + xLi+ + xe- in equilibrium with M + xLiH. Other reaction paths-involving solid solutions, metastable distorted phases, and phases with low hydrogen content-were recently reported for TiH2 and Mg2FeH6, Mg2CoH5 and Mg2NiH4. The importance of fundamental aspects to overcome technological difficulties is discussed with a focus on conversion reaction limitations in the case of MgH2. The influence of MgH2 particle size, mechanical grinding, hydrogen sorption cycles, grinding with carbon, reactive milling under hydrogen, and metal and catalyst addition to the MgH2/carbon composite on kinetics improvement and reversibility is presented. Drastic technological improvement in order to the enhance conversion process efficiencies is needed for practical applications. The main goals are minimizing the impact of electrode volume variation during lithium extraction and overcoming the poor electronic conductivity of LiH. To use polymer binders to improve the cycle life of the hydride-based electrode and to synthesize nanoscale composite hydride can be helpful to address these drawbacks. The development of high-capacity hydride anodes should be inspired by the emergent nano-research prospects which share the knowledge of both hydrogen-storage and lithium-anode communities. © 2015 Aymard et al.","Conversion reaction; Lithium-ion batteries; Metal hydrides","Anodes; Bins; Carbon; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Grinding (machining); Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Metals; Metastable phases; Particle size; Secondary batteries; Conversion reactions; Electrode polarizations; Electronic conductivity; Mechanical grinding; Metal hydrides; Reversible capacity; Technological improvements; Thermodynamic predictions; Lithium-ion batteries"

This competition has been studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). Products were characterized by IR, solution- and solid-state NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single-crystal or powder X-ray diffraction analysis. For hydrated salts, thermal decomposition proceeded in three stages, loss of water to form first hexahydrated then trihydrated, and finally loss of water and hydrogen to form polyhydroxylated complexes. For partially ammoniated salts, two stages of thermal decomposition were observed as ammonia and hydrogen were released with weight loss first of 14% and then 5.5%. Thermal decomposition of methanolated salts proceeded through a single step with a total weight loss of 32% with the release of methanol, methane, and hydrogen. All the gaseous products of thermal decomposition were characterized by using mass spectrometry. Residual solid materials were characterized by solid-state 11B magic-angle spinning (MAS)NMR spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction analysis by which the molecular structures of hexahydrated and trihydrated complexes were solved. Both hydrogen and dihydrogen bonds were observed in structures of [Mg(H2O)6B12H12]η6H 2O and [Mg(CH3OH)6B12H 12]η6CH3OH, which were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.

Thus, the chapter focuses on aspects of hydrogen storage options, be it liquid, compressed, cryo-comperssed or materials based on the physical and chemical ways. It includes information on emerging mechanisms for reversible storage of hydrogen. Hydrogen storage options have several critical features that have to be solved. In general, the weight, volume and cost of hydrogen storage systems is too high and the durability of hydrogen storage systems is inadequate. High-pressure cylinders for compressed gas and other high-pressure elements limit the choice of construction materials and fabrication techniques within weight, volume, performance and cost constraints. Furthermore, hydrogen refuelling times are too long. Research is also needed on improving hydrogen discharge kinetics and simplifying the reactor required for discharging hydrogen on board the vehicle, such as the volume, weight and operation to name a few. For metal hydrides weight, system volume and refuelling time are the primary issues.

In this study, the thermal properties of Y(BH4)3 synthesized via two different methods are extensively examined. One method relies on the solid-solid metathesis reaction between LiBH4 and YCl3, and the other method is the gas-solid reaction between B2H6 and YH 3. The two samples are studied by differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry, and X-ray diffraction. They exhibit distinctly different polymorphic phase transformation and melting. It turns out that the side product LiCl in the metathesis reaction, which has been regarded as being inert, shifts the melting point and promotes the formation of YB4 during decomposition. Differential scanning calorimetry and in situ X-ray diffraction data indicate that the addition of LiBH4 to Y(BH4) 3 induces co-melting as is found in the cases of LiBH 4-Ca(BH4)2 or LiBH4-Mg(BH 4)2. Melt infiltration of Y(BH4)3 into mesoporous carbon cage confirms such melting behavior. Copyright © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Reducing the thermodynamic stability of MgH2 is now the main challenging task. In this study, 21 different elements were added to magnesium in atomic scale by using the High-Pressure Torsion (HPT) technique and different kinds of nanostructured intermetallics and new metastable or amorphous phases were synthesized after HPT (Mg17Al12, MgZn, MgAg, Mg2In, Mg2Sn, etc.) or after post-HPT heat treatment (MgB2, Mg2Si, Mg2Ni, Mg2Cu, MgCo, Mg2Ge, Mg2Pd, etc.).

Complex metal hydrides such as NaAlH4 and LiBH4 have attractive hydrogen contents. However, hydrogen release and especially uptake after desorption are sluggish and require high temperatures and pressures. Kinetics can be greatly enhanced by nanostructuring, for instance by confining metal hydrides in a porous carbon scaffold. We present for a detailed study of the impact of the nature of the carbon-metal hydride interface on the hydrogen storage properties. Nanostructures were prepared by melt infiltration of either NaAlH4 or LiBH4 into a carbon scaffold, of which the surface had been modified, varying from H-terminated to oxidized (up to 4.4 O/nm2). It has been suggested that the chemical and electronic properties of the carbon/metal hydride interface can have a large influence on hydrogen storage properties. However, no significant impact on the first H2 release temperatures was found. In contrast, the surface properties of the carbon played a major role in determining the reversible hydrogen storage capacity. Only a part of the oxygen-containing groups reacted with hydrides during melt infiltration, but further reaction during cycling led to significant losses, with reversible hydrogen storage capacity loss up to 40% for surface oxidized carbon. However, if the carbon surface had been hydrogen terminated, ∼6 wt% with respect to the NaAlH4 weight was released in the second cycle, corresponding to 95% reversibility. This clearly shows that control over the nature and amount of surface groups offers a strategy to achieve fully reversible hydrogen storage in complex metal hydride-carbon nanocomposites. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Mechanical milling is commonly used to process complex powder systems for solid-state hydrogen storage; however, milling can also be used to evolve nanostructured powder to modify hydrogen sorption characteristics. In the present study, cryomilling (mechanical attrition milling in a cryogenic liquid) is used to produce nanostructured palladium-rhodium alloy powder. Characterization of the cryomilled Pd-10Rh using electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and surface area analysis reveal that (i) particle morphology evolves from spherical to flattened disk-like particles; while (ii) crystallite size decreases from several microns to less than 100 nm; and (iii) dislocation density increases with increased cryomilling time. Hydrogen absorption and desorption isotherms as well as the time scales for absorption were measured for cryomilled Pd-10Rh, and correlated with observed microstructural changes induced by the cryomilling process. In short, as the microstructure of the Pd-10Rh alloy is refined by cryomilling: (i) the maximum hydrogen concentration in the α-phase increases, (ii) the pressure plateau becomes flatter and (iii) the equilibrium hydrogen capacity increases at pressure of 101.3 kPa. Additionally, the rate of hydrogen absorption was reduced by an order of magnitude compared to non-cryomilled (atomized) powder. © 2014, Elsevier Ltd.

The hydrogen storage capacity of metallic glassy hydrides (MGHs) is obviously higher than that of their crystalline counterparts owing to the free volume and disordered atomic structure associated with glasses. The glass-to-glass transition is demonstrated by direct experimental observation using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Remarkably, the dehydrogenation temperature of the MGHs can be efficiently tuned as it shows a close relationship with the enthalpy of mixing between the alloying element and hydrogen, and can be decreased from ∼350 °C to ∼150 °C when alloying with 5 at.%-Cu.

The molecular structure of Al(BH4)3· 6NH3 is resolved by high-resolution X-ray diffraction. The compound crystallized in the space group Pbcn (No. 60), with lattice parameters of a = 13.2824(5) Å, b = 15.2698(7) Å and c = 13.1848(6) Å. Structure analysis shows that this compound contains complex hexamminealuminum (III) [Al(NH3)6]3+ cations, which are surrounded by BH4- anions. The interatomic distances between the Hδ+s from the NH3 units and the Hδ-s from the BH4 units are in the range of 1.91-2.19 Å, suggesting the presence of significant Hδ+â|̄-δH interactions. Mass spectrometry, thermogravimetry and temperature-programmed desorption studies of metal cation-modified aluminum-based borohydride ammoniates using the reactions of various metal borohydrides M(BH4)n (M = Na, Li, Ca, Mg) and chlorides MCln (M = Sc, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mg, Ca, Li) reveal that their dehydrogenation properties are strongly dependent on the polarizing power of the added metal cations. It is hypothesized that the added metal cations may activate the borohydride ion to such an extent that its H δ- can easily react with the Hδ+ of the [Al(NH3)6]3+ cation, resulting in an enhanced interaction between the Hδ+ and Hδ-, thus enhancing their dehydrogenation kinetics. Subsequent deuterium isotope and X-ray measurements support the hypothesis that the Hδ+â|̄ -δH interactions play a role in the dehydrogenation of the metal borohydride ammoniates. Of the systems investigated, 0.5Mg(BH 4)2/Li2Al(BH4)5· 6NH3 is notable as it releases more than 10 wt.% high-purity H 2 within 30 min below 120 C.

The metal hydrogen system has a high volumetric energy density and is often reversible with a high cycle life. However, improving the often poor gravimetric performance of such systems through the use of lightweight metals usually comes at the cost of reduced reaction rates or the requirement of pressure and temperature conditions far from the desired operating conditions. Most studies of reaction kinetics of such systems focus on fitting low-dimensional kinetic models to measured rates and inferring the rate-limiting process based on the quality of the fit. This work develops a methodology for describing these reactions using a multi-process model of the physical transport and energy state transitions of interstitial hydrogen atoms within a metal lattice. In its nondimensional form, this model is applicable to arbitrary geometries and dimensions using four nondimensional kinetic parameters based on the physical transport mechanisms present in the system. The proposed model is then used for LaNi5 and TiCrMn to examine how the nucleation pattern, kinetic parameters, and particle aspect ratio affect the time of formation of a closed hydride layer and the apparent measured kinetics. The analysis is applied to both hydriding and dehydriding processes to show how different kinetic limitation mechanisms can manifest when considering the reciprocal reaction. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

In this work MgH2 powder with 5 wt.% TiO2 was ball milled for 10 h. The as-milled nanostructured powder was enriched with 5 wt.% of Expanded Natural Graphite (ENG) and then compacted in cylindrical pellets by cold pressing using different loads. Both the powder and the pellets were subjected to kinetic and thermodynamic tests using a Sievert's type gas reaction controller, in order to study the microstructural and kinetic changes which took place during repeated H2 absorption and desorption cycles. The pellets exhibited good kinetic performance and durability, even if the pressure of compaction revealed to be an important parameter for their mechanical stability. Scanning Electron Microscopy observations of as-prepared and cycled pellets were carried out to investigate the evolution of their microstructure.

Hydrogen in solid-state could be stored either by physical adsorption (or physisorption) or by forming chemical bonds (or chemisorption). Activated carbon offers large internal pore surface area and high porosity that favors both physisorption and chemisorption. Other advantages of using activated carbon for electrochemical hydrogen storage are different pore sizes - macropores, mesopores, micropores and ultramicropores, low atomic weight and easy availability. The present chapter reports on experimental investigation on different grades of activated carbons, made from coal, for their electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity. The fabrication process of activated carbon-based solid electrodes is explained. The steps involved in testing of the fabricated electrodes for their electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity are given. The obtained hydrogen storage capacity of certain activated carbon electrodes is found to be above 1 wt% which is comparable with commercially available metal hydride-based hydrogen storage canisters, lithium-ion and lithium polymer batteries. The results pave a way forward towards commercializing activated carbon-based hydrogen storage electrodes for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell or PEMFC, and battery applications. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The desorption/absorption performances and reaction mechanism of the 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 composite system with SrFe12O19 additive have been investigated for the first time. Analysis of the temperature-programme-desorption showed that the 5 wt% SrFe12O19-doped 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 composite started to release hydrogen at 80 °C and 260 °C for the first two desorption stages, which were reduced by 40 °C and 10 °C as compared to the undoped composite. The sorption kinetics of 5 wt% SrFe12O19-doped 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 were also improved as compared to the undoped 4MgH2 + LiAlH4. Activation energy calculation based on the Kissinger plot displayed that the apparent activation energy for the decomposition of MgH2-relevant had been reduced from 121 kJ/mol for the undoped composite to 104 kJ/mol for the composite with SrFe12O19. The X-ray diffraction results suggested that the new species of Al2Sr and Li2Fe3O4 that were formed in situ during the heating process were believed to play a catalytic role, thus responsible for the enhancement of the hydrogen storage properties of 4MgH2 + LiAlH4 composite system with SrFe12O19. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Alanate; Catalyst; Destabilized system; Hydrogen storage; Magnesium hydride","Activation energy; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum compounds; Ball milling; Binary alloys; C (programming language); Catalysts; Chemical activation; Desorption; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Iron alloys; Iron compounds; Lithium alloys; Magnesium compounds; Strontium alloys; X ray diffraction; Alanates; Apparent activation energy; Destabilized system; Hydrogen storage properties; Magnesium hydride; Reaction mechanism; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Temperature programme; Lithium compounds"

An unsteady, two-dimensional (2-D) mathematical model of a metal hydride reaction bed of cylindrical configuration is developed for predicting the hydrogen storage capacity. The effect of volumetric radiation is accounted in the thermal model. Effects of hydride bed thickness, initial absorption temperature, hydride bed thermal conductivity, and hydrogen supply pressure on the hydrogen storage capacity are studied. A thinner hydride bed is found to enhance the hydriding rate, accomplishing a rapid reaction. At an operating condition of 20 bar supply pressure and 573 K initial absorption temperature, Mg2Ni stores about 36.7 g hydrogen per kg alloy. For a given bed thickness and an overall heat transfer coefficient, there exists an optimum value of hydride bed thermal conductivity.

Due to both a high gravimetric hydrogen capacity of 11.5 wt % and an ideal dehydrogenation enthalpy of 32 kJ mol-1 H 2, Ca(BH4)2 is considered to be one of the most interesting compounds in this class of materials. In this work, a comprehensive investigation of the effect of different selected additives (TiF4, NbF5, Ti-isopropoxide, and CaF2) on the reversible hydrogenation reaction of calcium borohydride is presented combining different investigation techniques. The chemical state of the Nb- and Ti-based additives is studied by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (e.g., XANES). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was used to show the local structure, size, and distribution of the additive/catalyst. 11B{1H} solid state magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) was carried out to detect possible amorphous phases. The formation of TiB 2 and NbB2 nanoparticles was observed after milling or upon sorption reactions of the Nb- and Ti-based Ca(BH4)2 doped systems.

(i) Hydrazine borane N2H4BH3 is readily destabilized by an alkali hydride MH (M=Li, Na, K). The electronic properties of M drive the reactivity of MH1 towards N2H4BH3. KH is the most reactive (at 25 °C, ΔrH = -70.25 kJ mol-1) while K is the least electronegative and the biggest element. Hydrazinidoboranes MN2H3BH3 form. (ii) Hydrazine borane N2H4BH3 is destabilized by MHx (x = 2, 3; M=Mg, Ca, Al). In comparison to pristine N2H4BH3, better dehydrogenation properties are found: MgH2 has a catalytic effect; CaH2 strongly destabilizes N2H4BH3; and, unstable AlH3 is able to destabilize N2H4BH3 under heating. Though the synthesis of hydrazinidoboranes M(N2H3BH3)x is difficult, the mixtures MHx-N2H4BH3 leads to composites. The most efficient composite is CaH2-N2H4BH3.

Previous studies have shown that by nanoconfinement of ammonia borane within a porous support some of these limitations can be overcome due to the reduction and stabilization of ammonia borane particle size. However, this effect was only observed with moderate ammonia borane loadings, as with higher loadings the pores of the support became obstructed. In this work, silica aerogels produced by CO2 drying, with pore volumes up to 2 cm3/g, have been used to confine ammonia borane. The influence of the amount of ammonia borane loaded on the aerogel support on the thermal and structural properties of the material has been analyzed. It has been found that more than 60 wt% of ammonia borane can be effectively stored in the pores of the aerogel support. The resulting material shows faster hydrogen release kinetics by thermolysis at 80 °C, due to a significant reduction in the mea size of ammonia borane after confinement and the participation of SiOH and SiOSi groups of silica aerogel in the decomposition mechanism. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Ammonia borane; Nanoconfined; Silica aerogel; Solid state hydrogen storage; Supercritical carbon dioxide","Aerogels; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Decomposition; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Particle size; Silica; Silica gel; Supercritical fluid extraction; Thermolysis; Ammonia borane; Nanoconfined; Silica aerogels; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Ammonia"

In this work, the H 2 sorption of NaAlH4 doped with TiCl3, ScCl3 or CeCl3 is systematically studied. The doped samples were prepared in one step by reactive ball milling of NaH and Al with 4 mol.% dopant in an H2 atmosphere. The efficiencies of the dopants are different for desorption and absorption, indicating that different catalytic mechanisms and rate limiting steps are taking place during both steps and these are described here. TiCl3 is more efficient for desorption and CeCl3 for absorption. ScCl3 is less efficient than the first two for all reactions. A mixture of TiCl3 and CeCl3 is thus added to NaAlH4 to act at the same time on the desorption and the absorption processes.

We prepared high loadings of nanosized NaAlH4 confined in the pores of a carbon support by melt infiltration. XRD, nitrogen physisorption, high pressure DSC and solid-state NMR are used to evidence that the molten NaAlH4 infiltrates the carbon support, and forms a nanosized NaAlH4 phase lacking long-range order. The confined NaAlH4 shows enhanced hydrogen dehydrogenation properties and rehydrogenation under mild conditions that is attributed to the nanosize and close contact to the carbon matrix. © 2010 American Chemical Society.","","Activation energy; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Physisorption; Seepage; Soil mechanics; X ray diffraction; A-carbon; Carbon matrix; Carbon support; Comprehensive studies; Dehydrogenation properties; High activation energy; High loadings; High pressure; Hydrogen release; Long range orders; Mass transfer limitation; Melt infiltration; Nano-meter scale; Nano-size; Nano-sized; Rehydrogenation; Solid state NMR; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Thermodynamical properties; XRD; Sodium compounds"

However, no material yet researched comes close to reaching the DOE 2015 targets of 9 wt% and 80 kgm-3 at this time. To increase the physisorption capacities of these materials, the heats of adsorption must be increased to ̃20 kJ mol-1. This can be accomplished by optimizing the material structure, creating more active species on the surface, or improving the interaction of the surface with hydrogen. The main focus of this progress report are recent advances in physisorption materials exhibiting higher heats of adsorption and better hydrogen adsorption at room temperature based on exploiting the Kubas model for hydrogen binding: (η2-H2)-metal interaction. Both computational approaches and synthetic achievements will be discussed. Materials exploiting the Kubas interaction represent a median on the continuum between metal hydrides and physisorption materials, and are becoming increasingly important as researchers learn more about their applications to hydrogen storage problems.","","Building materials; Gas adsorption; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Physisorption; Research; Scheduling; Active species; Computational approach; Heats of adsorption; Hydrogen adsorption; Hydrogen binding; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen storage materials; Material structure; Metal hydrides; Metal interactions; Progress report; Room temperature; Solid-state materials; Stumbling blocks; Hydrogen storage"

Hydrogen sorption and desorption properties of the films, free from the influence of substrates, were investigated. Oxidation of the material was reduced through the use of a sandwiched free-standing film structure in which the top and bottom layers consist of nanometer-thick Pd layers, which also acted as a catalyst to promote hydrogen uptake and release. Hydrogen storage characteristics were studied at three temperatures, 296, 232, and 180°C, where multiple sorption/desorption cycles were measured gravimetrically. An improvement in hydrogen storage capacity over the bulk Mg-Ni target material was found for the free-standing films. As shown from a Van't Hoff plot, the thermodynamic stability of the nanograined films is similar to that of Mg2Ni.

Severe plastic deformation (SPD) processing techniques are being explored as an alternative to high-energy ball-milling (HEBM) in order to obtain more air resistant materials and reduce processing times. In this work, Mg, MgH2, and MgH2-Fe mixtures were severely mechanically processed by different techniques such as high-pressure torsion (HPT), extensive cold forging, and cold rolling. A very significant grain refinement was achieved when using MgH2 instead of Mg as raw material. The mean crystallite sizes observed ranged from 10 to 30 nm, depending on the processing conditions. Enhanced H-sorption properties were observed for the MgH 2-based nanocomposites processed by HPT when compared with MgH 2 mixtures.

Current hydrogen storage options, such as compressed gas and liquid hydrogen, fall short of meeting vehicle manufacturers' goals for safe and efficient energy storage. The most viable long-term alternative to these options is solid-state storage, which has been proven both safe and efficient. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL), with over 50 years of hydrogen storage expertise and over 25 years of expertise in solid-state storage, is working with the Department of Energy's Hydrogen Storage Center of Excellence in Metal Hydrides to help solve this key challenge. A considerable amount of the Center's current efforts involve research to develop new high capacity hydrogen storage materials. However the overall objective of the Center is to deliver a 1 kg of hydrogen prototype vessel that meets the 2010 U.S. DOE FreedomCAR targets, which includes 6wt% hydrogen in the system. To meet this challenging target, will not only require the development of a new light weight hydrogen storage material but also, will require similar breakthroughs in vessel and system design, engineering and fabrication technology. SRNL is leading this systems engineering and analysis activity for the DOE Metal Hydride Center of Excellence. The SRNL team is comprised of distinguished scientists and engineers from national laboratories, leading universities, and major corporate research centers that have extensive experience in solid-state hydrogen storage systems as well as supporting expertise in heat transfer, systems modeling and component and systems development and manufacturing. To meet the FreedomCAR storage goals, engineering and system development tasks will need to be worked in parallel with material development. This approach will ensure that material development and engineering efforts are coordinated and focused on creating a suitable storage material and a compatible storage container. This approach considers the many required tradeoffs. For example, selection of a hydrogen storage material with a high equilibrium pressure could adversely affect the vessel's pressure design and, in turn, its weight, and perhaps the overall hydrogen charging time. Lower pressure materials would permit the use of lightweight storage containers and even possible conformable tank shapes. The Center's efforts will build on the experience and ongoing work of its lead and partners. The Center will also share its knowledge and expertise to solve emerging safety and engineering issues. The major engineering and system development tasks being carried out by the center include: • Heat transfer modeling and verification • Engineering materials property measurements i.e. kinetics, heat capacity, packing density, cycling performance etc. • Material production scale-up. • Safety issues including risk identification and mitigation. • Subsystem fabrication and testing • Prototype system fabrication and testing • System modeling and integration. • Manufacturability and cost estimates.

In the both states, it was found that X prefers Mg 2Ni-X to Mg-Ni-X solid solution, and that the preference is stronger in the hydrided state. The effect is more pronounced for elements X from the 13th group. Suggested explanation was based on influence of X on the formation enthalpy of hydrides.

In cycling experiments at 300 °C, between pressures of 1 × 10-2 bar H2 and 6 bar H2, reaction rates for dehydrogenation and hydrogenation were found to be up to 15 times quicker than for milled MgH2 with no additives.

The elements of a metal hydride reactor are hydrogen supply duct, internal hydrogen distribution, hydride bed, reactor shell and the flow domain of the heat transfer fluid. Internal hydrogen distribution and hydride bed are porous media. Therefore, hydrogen flows through non-porous and porous regions during its reversible exothermic absorption and endothermic desorption, respectively. The interface between porous and non-porous regions is a discontinuity with respect to energy transport mechanisms. Hence, Danckwerts-type boundary conditions for the energy balance equation are introduced. Application of the first and second law of thermodynamics to the interface reveals that temperature jumps may occur at the hydrogen inlet but are not allowed at the hydrogen outlet. Exemplarily the loading behavior of a metal hydride storage tank based on sodium alanate is analyzed. It is demonstrated and experimentally validated that only Danckwerts-type boundary conditions predict the important cooling effect of the inlet hydrogen on the exothermic absorption process correctly. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Chemical reactors; Energy; Entropy; Heat transfer; Mathematical modeling; Porous media","Absorption; Absorption cooling; Boundary conditions; Chemical reactors; Desorption; Heat transfer; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Metals; Porous materials; Sodium; Sodium compounds; Virtual storage; Absorption process; Cooling effects; Energy; Energy balance equations; Energy transport; Flow domains; Heat transfer fluids; Hydride bed; Hydrogen distribution; Hydrogen flow; Hydrogen supply; Mathematical modeling; Metal hydride storage; Metal hydrides; Second Law of Thermodynamics; Sodium alanates; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Temperature jump; Thermal behaviors; Hydrides"

Aside from removing the heat, the heat exchanger must be able to accomplish this task in an acceptably short period of time. A near-term target for this 'fill-time' is less than 5 min. In this two-part study, a new class of heat exchangers is proposed for automobile hydrogen storage systems. The first part discussed the design methodology and a 2-D computational model that was constructed to explore the thermal and kinetic behavior of the metal hydride. This paper discusses the experimental setup and testing of a prototype heat exchanger using Ti 1.1CrMn as HPMH storage material. Tests were performed to examine the influence of pressurization profile, coolant flow rate and coolant temperature on metal hydride temperature and reaction rate. The experimental data are compared with predictions of the 2-D model to validate the model, calculate reaction progress and determine fill time. The prototype heat exchanger successfully achieved a fill time of 4 min 40 s with a combination of fast pressurization and low coolant temperature.

In order to sustain the sorption of hydrogen during this exothermic process, the generated heat has to be removed effectively. Release of hydrogen is an endothermic process needing supply of heat to the metal hydride matrix. Depending on the application, the heat transfer medium can be either a liquid or a gas. Reduction of the total weight of hydrogen storage devices is essential towards utilization of hydrogen for mobile and portable applications. While a variety of new storage materials with desirable sorption characteristics are being suggested, optimal thermal design of the storage device remains a major challenge. Lack of thermodynamic, transport and thermophysical property data of the material particles and of the bed is another drawback which needs to be addressed. © 2010 by ASME.","Carbon; Effective thermal conductivity; Heat and mass transfer; Hydrogen storage; Metal hydride","Carbon; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Mass transfer; Sorption; Thermodynamic properties; Virtual storage; Effective thermal conductivity; Endothermic process; Exothermic process; Heat and mass transfer; Material particles; Metal hydrides; Optimal thermal design; Portable applications; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Sorption characteristics; Heat transfer"

However, the exothermic reaction of hydrogen with this material releases large amounts of heat, and the reaction rate depends on the metal hydride temperature, decreasing significantly if the heat is not removed quickly. Therefore, a powerful heat exchanger constitutes the most crucial component of a HPMH hydrogen storage system. For automobiles, this heat exchanger must enable fueling 5 kg of hydrogen in less than 5 min. This is a formidable challenge considering the enormous amount of heat that must be released and the stringent limits on the heat exchanger's weight and volume, let alone a host of manufacturing requirements. Unlike conventional heat exchangers that are designed to exchange heat between two fluids, this heat exchanger is quite unique in that it must dissipate heat between a reacting powder and a coolant. In this first of a two-part study, a systematic heat exchanger design methodology is presented, starting with a 1-D criterion and progressing through a series of engineering decisions supported by computations of fill time. A final design is arrived at that meets the 5-min fill time requirement corresponding to minimum heat exchanger mass, supported by a 2-D computational model of the heat exchanger's thermal and kinetic response. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Hydride-infiltrated samples were synthesized by melt infiltration, achieving loadings up to 21 wt %. MOF-74(Mg) possesses one-dimensional, 12 Å channels lined with Mg atoms having open coordination sites, which can serve as sites for Ti catalyst stabilization. MOF-74(Mg) is stable under repeated hydrogen desorption and hydride regeneration cycles, allowing it to serve as a ""nanoreactor"". Confining NaAlH4 within these pores alters the decomposition pathway by eliminating the stable intermediate Na3AlH6 phase observed during bulk decomposition and proceeding directly to NaH, Al, and H2, in agreement with theory. The onset of hydrogen desorption for both Ti-doped and undoped nano-NaAlH4@MOF-74(Mg) is ∼50 °C, nearly 100 °C lower than bulk NaAlH4. However, the presence of titanium is not necessary for this increase in desorption kinetics but enables rehydriding to be almost fully reversible. Isothermal kinetic studies indicate that the activation energy for H2 desorption is reduced from 79.5 kJ mol-1 in bulk Ti-doped NaAlH4 to 57.4 kJ mol-1 for nanoconfined NaAlH4. The structural properties of nano-NaAlH 4@MOF-74(Mg) were probed using 23Na and 27Al solid-state MAS NMR, which indicates that the hydride is not decomposed during infiltration and that Al is present as tetrahedral AlH4 ® anions prior to desorption and as Al metal after desorption. Because of the highly ordered MOF structure and monodisperse pore dimensions, our results allow key template features to be identified to ensure reversible, low-temperature hydrogen storage. © 2012 American Chemical Society.","hydrogen storage; metal hydrides; metal-organic frameworks; nanoconfinement; nanoreactors; reversibility","Aluminum Compounds; Hydrogen; Magnesium; Materials Testing; Molecular Conformation; Nanostructures; Particle Size; Sodium Compounds; Surface Properties; Titanium; Activation energy; Aluminum; Crystalline materials; Desorption; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Nanoreactors; Sodium; Sodium compounds; Titanium; aluminum derivative; hydrogen; magnesium; nanomaterial; sodium aluminum hydride; sodium derivative; titanium; Al-metal; Catalyst stabilization; Coordination sites; Decomposition pathway; Desorption kinetics; Hydrogen desorption; Isothermal kinetics; Loss-of-capacity; Low temperatures; MAS NMR; Melt infiltration; Metal hydrides; Metal organic framework; Monodisperse; Nanoconfinements; Pore dimensions; Regeneration cycles; reversibility; article; chemistry; conformation; isolation and purification; materials testing; particle size; surface property; ultrastructure; Java programming language"

In this report, we present gravimetric and volumetric capacities of a hydrogen storage system based on a densified MOF-177 adsorbent. This is, to our knowledge, the first thorough study of an engineered industrial scale MOFs for hydrogen storage application. The measurements were performed over the 50-120 K and 0-40 bar ranges, and modeled using micropore filling approaches. The performances of a potential 100 L vessel filled with the densified MOF-177 are inferred from the modeling parameters. A comparison of this technology with the 70 MPa compressed gas hydrogen system shows under which conditions the adsorbent offer advantages in terms of volumetric and gravimetric capacities. Further comparison with AX-21 activated carbon pellets reveals that densified MOF-177 stores about 40% more at 77 K and 35 bar. In order to get a physically sound modeling analysis, we introduced an approach to establish effective saturation pressures for supercritical adsorption. This approach insures a consistency between key model parameters and the observed liquid properties of the adsorbed phase at the lowest temperatures. We show that modeling using temperature-dependent saturation pressures and adsorbed phase densities leads to important differences in the projected usable storage capacities. Such differences can be as much as 25% at 50 K in the high pressure limit, revealing the importance of physical insights in the modeling approach. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Activated carbon; Electric vehicles; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Gas adsorption; Hydrogen; Java programming language; Models; Compressed gas; Effective saturation; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Gravimetric capacity; High-pressure limits; Hydrogen storage medium; Hydrogen storage system; Hydrogen system; Industrial scale; Key models; Liquid properties; Micropore filling; Modeling approach; Modeling parameters; Phase density; Pilot scale; Saturation pressure; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Sound modeling; Storage capacity; Supercritical adsorption; Temperature dependent; Volumetric capacity; activated carbon; adsorption; comparative study; electric vehicle; experimental study; fuel cell; gravimetry; hydrogen; numerical model; performance assessment; pressure effect; Hydrogen storage"

Such phase transformation induces important structural changes such as volume expansion (either isotropic and anisotropic), symmetry lowering, hydrogen ordering and phase transitions. In some cases, change of the electronic structure, from metallic to ionocovalent state, is reported. Finally, amorphization can occur leading to disproportionation of the parent compound.

NaAlH4 is the only complex metal hydride identified so far that combines favorable thermodynamics with a reasonable hydrogen storage capacity (5.5 wt %) when decomposing in two steps to NaH, Al, and H2. The slow kinetics and poor reversibility of the hydrogen desorption can be combatted by the addition of a Ti-based catalyst. In an alternative approach we studied the influence of a reduced NaAlH4 particle size and the presence of a carbon support. We focused on NaAlH4/porous carbon nanocomposites prepared by melt infiltration. The NaAlH4 was confined in the mainly 2-3 nm pores of the carbon, resulting in a lack of long-range order in the NaAlH4 structure. The hydrogen release profile was modified by contact with the carbon; even for ∼10 nm NaAlH4 on a nonporous carbon material the decomposition of NaAlH4 to NaH, Al, and H2 now led to hydrogen release in a single step. This was a kinetic effect, with the temperature at which the hydrogen was released depending on the NaAlH4 feature size. However, confinement in a nanoporous carbon material was essential to not only achieve low H2 release temperatures, but also rehydrogenation at mild conditions (e.g., 24 bar H 2 at 150 °C). Not only had the kinetics of hydrogen sorption improved, but the thermodynamics had also changed. When hydrogenating at conditions at which Na3AlH6 would be expected to be the stable phase (e.g., 40 bar H2 at 160 °C), instead nanoconfined NaAlH4 was formed, indicating a shift of the NaAlH 4↔Na3AlH6 thermodynamic equilibrium in these nanocomposites compared to bulk materials. © 2010 American Chemical Society.","","Decomposition; Desorption; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Lithium batteries; Nanocomposites; Smelting; Sodium; Thermodynamics; A-carbon; Alternative approach; Bulk materials; Complex metals; Feature sizes; Hydrogen desorption; Hydrogen release; Hydrogen sorption; Hydrogen storage capacities; Kinetic effect; Long range orders; Melt infiltration; Metal hydrides; Nanoporous carbons; Non-porous carbon; Porous carbons; Rehydrogenation; Single-step; Solid-state storage; Stable phase; Thermodynamic equilibria; Sodium compounds"

NaNH2BH3 is a promising solid-state hydrogen storage material, known to dehydrogenate in milder conditions than its parent compound. The preparation was made from sodium hydride NaH and NH3BH3 according to three different energy-efficient routes: namely, ball-milling, grinding in a mortar, and simple mixing with a spatula. In each case, NaNH2BH3 was formed. In other words, it has been demonstrated that the solid-solid reaction between NaH and NH3BH3 can take place by simple contact of these molecules, owing to the basic character of the former and the acidity of the latter. The as-formed materials dehydrogenate to a high extent at low temperature, with ca. 2 equivalent hydrogen H2 (NH3-free in our conditions) evolving at temperatures up to 95 °C. An effective gravimetric hydrogen density of ca. 7.4 wt% was calculated, which may correspond to an effective capacity of 3.7 wt% (assuming the weight of NaNH 2BH3 amounts to 50% of the weight of the whole storage system).

A sustainable energy society in which a hydrogen economy predominates will require renewable generation provided, for example, by artificial photosynthesis and clean, efficient energy conversion effected, for example, by hydrogen fuel cells. Vital in the hydrogen cycle is the ability to store hydrogen safely and effectively. Solid-state storage in hydrides enables this but no material yet satisfies all the demands associated with storage density and hydrogen release and uptake; particularly for mobile power. Nanochemical design methods present potential routes to overcome the thermodynamic and kinetic hurdles associated with solid state storage in hydrides. In this review we discuss strategies of nanosizing, nanoconfinement, morphological/dimensional control, and application of nanoadditives on the hydrogen storage performance of metal hydrides. We present recent examples of how such approaches can begin to address the challenges and an evaluation of prospects for further development. © CSIRO 2012.","","Energy conversion; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Storage (materials); Artificial photosynthesis; Design method; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen Energy; Hydrogen release; Metal hydrides; Nano-structured; Nanoadditives; Nanoconfinements; Nanosizing; Point of use; Potential solutions; Renewable generation; Solid-state storage; Storage densities; Storage performance; Sustainable energy; Hydrogen storage"

Although many advances in hydrogen production and usage have been made, storing hydrogen remains a significant challenge. Many drawbacks including energy intensive processes, low volumetric densities, and safety concerns are associated with storing hydrogen as pressured or liquefied. Solid state hydrogen storage is considered to be the most promising method as a safe and effective storage option, but there is still no material or method that satisfies the requirements for a practical approach. A feasible hydrogen storage media should address several issues including targeted storage capacities, thermodynamics and hydrogen sorption kinetics, and safety. Nanostructured materials can provide tailor-made properties for storing and releasing hydrogen to fulfill, at least, the partial requirements. This short review, not a comprehensive review of all the materials or technologies in hydrogen storage, summarizes some of the recent developments in application of nanostructures for solid state hydrogen storage; particular attention has been devoted to the most recent development of nanocomposites with tuned dehydrogenation temperatures and kinetics through the control of pore size and surface chemistry. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Carbon cryogel; Hydride; Hydrogen storage; Mesoporosity; Nanocomposite","Fossil fuels; Hydrogen production; Materials; Nanocomposites; Nanostructured materials; Nanostructures; Renewable energy resources; Sorption; Storage (materials); Surface chemistry; Thermodynamics; Alternate fuels; Carbon-based; Cryogels; Hydrogen sorption; Hydrogen storage media; Mesoporosity; Renewable energy source; Safety concerns; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Storage capacity; Volumetric density; Hydrogen storage"

The apparent activation energy of the decomposition of Na 3AlH 6, which is the decomposition product in the first dehydrogenation step of NaAlH 4, is equal to ~140 kJ/mol and ~101 kJ/mol for ball milled NaAlH 4 and NaAlH 4 +5 wt% n-Ni, respectively, as determined by the Kissinger method in DSC tests. The apparent activation energy for the decomposition of NaH, which is the decomposition product in the second dehydrogenation step of Na 3AlH 6, is estimated as equal to ~143 kJ/mol and ~226 kJ/mol for ball milled NaAlH 4 and NaAlH 4+5 wt% n-Ni, respectively. It seems that the n-Ni additive accelerates the decomposition of Na 3AlH 6 but decelerates the decomposition of NaH. Volumetric desorption tests indicate a substantial enhancement of the rate of hydrogen desorption at 170 °C for the ball milled NaAlH 4+5 wt% n-Ni nanocomposite as a result of the catalytic action of n-Ni. No reaction of n-Ni with the NaAlH 4 matrix is observed during dehydrogenation at 170-280 °C. The n-Ni catalyst used in the present work compares very favorably with other catalytic additives reported in the literature (e.g., metal chlorides) which were used for the enhancement of dehydrogenation of NaAlH 4.

Borohydrides such as LiBH4 have been studied or proposed as candidates for hydrogen storage because of their high hydrogen contents (18.4 wt% for LiBH4). Limited success has been made in reducing the dehydrogenation temperature. However, full reversibility has not been realized. It is found that the dehydrogenation mechanism of metal borohydrides differs signicantly from the well-known metal hydrides such as LaNi5H 6 and MgH2 that release hydrogen in a single decomposition step through a solid state transformation of crystalline structure. The dehydrogenation of lithium borohydrides involves solid-liquid-gas reactions. Some of the steps in the multiple step decomposition processes of metal borohydrides are not reversible. Furthermore, the decomposition also produces stable intermediate compounds that cannot be rehydrided easily. Lastly, the volatile gases, such as BH3 and B2H6, evolved in decomposition of the transition metal borohydrides cause unrecoverable boron loss. Although our experiments show the partial reversibility of the doped LiBH4, it was not sustainable during dehydriding-rehydriding cycles because of the accumulation of hydrogen inert species and boron loss. Doping with additives reduces the stability of LiBH4, but it also makes LiBH4 less reversible. It raises reasonable doubt on the feasibility of making metal borohydrides suitable for reversible hydrogen storage. © 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the synthesis of Ca(BH4)2 by metathesis reaction via ball milling of a mixture of LiBH4 and CaCl2 is described. The effectiveness of this synthesis technique and the possible substitution of Cl ions in the borohydride phases is analysed depending on the back-pressure used for milling. When performed by ball milling under Ar, the metathesis reaction is not successful. A large quantity of a solid solution Li(BH4)1-xClx remains in the sample and CaHCl is formed rather than Ca(BH4)2. In contrast, the use of H2 back-pressure during milling favours the borohydride phases rather than CaHCl and leads to the formation of a solid solution Ca(BH4)2-yCly where [BH4] - groups are partially substituted by Cl ions. This compound has a similar structure as β-Ca(BH4)2 but with smaller lattice parameters. It is present in the as-milled sample together with LiCl and Li(BH4)1-xClx. The decomposition of the mixture occurs at lower temperature than for pure LiBH4 but higher than for pure Ca(BH4)2. The presence of chlorides in the structure of borohydride compounds changes dramatically the thermal properties of the material prepared and should be considered each time a metathesis reaction is used for synthesis. © 2010 Professor T.

The specific application here is 10 mol% addition of CaX2 (X = F, Cl) to Ca(BH4)2. The materials are analyzed using in-situ X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry, and IR spectroscopy, and the experimental results are compared against theoretical predictions from first-principles. Interestingly, in a fully hydrogenated state, CaCl2 dissolves into Ca(BH4)2 whereas CaF2 exists as a separate phase. During the course of dehydrogenation, CaH2-CaF2 solid solution, CaHCl, and a new Ca-H-Cl compound are observed. In-situ X-ray diffraction study reveals that CaX2 interacts with Ca(BH 4)2 in the early stage of decomposition, which could facilitate a direct decomposition of Ca(BH4)2 into CaH2 and CaB6 without forming intermediate phases such as CaB2Hx which seem to be thermodynamically in close competition with the formation of CaH2 and CaB6. Our first-principles calculation estimates that the decrease in the decomposition temperature due to the CaH2-CaX2 interaction would be less than 10 °C, and therefore the major contribution of CaX2 is to change the dehydrogenation pathway rather than the overall thermodynamics. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

BET and statistical thickness methods were used to characterize the support surface properties, and SEM micrographs gave a better understanding of the preparation techniques. It has been observed by TPD volumetric measurements that the confinement of the reactive borohydrides on the nanoporous supports leads to a lower dehydrogenation temperature compared to unsupported borohydrides. Moreover, a further decrease of the dehydrogenation temperature has been observed by increasing the specific surface area of the support and the pores volume and by using the prepared mixtures instead of pure materials.

Solid-state hydrogen storage is the safest and most efficient method for hydrogen storage. Most of the metal hydrides exhibit very large volumetric storage density but less than 5 wt % gravimetric hydrogen density. Light metals such as Al, B bind with four hydrogen atoms and form together with an alkali metal an ionic or partially covalent compound called complex hydride. LiBH4 is a complex hydride with 18.5 mass % gravimetric hydrogen density and 121 kg/m3 volumetric hydrogen storage capacity. The desorption temperature of LiBH4 is greater than 470°C, thus making it difficult to use for storage applications. In addition, the conditions for reversible reaction are unfavorable. Modification of thermodynamics of the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reaction is possible by using additives which could destabilize LiBH4 by stabilizing the dehydrogenated state. This could decrease the heat of reaction and reduce the desorption temperature at the same time, making the conditions for reversible reaction more optimum. Several additives which could destabilize LiBH 4 have been reviewed. © 2010 by Begell House, Inc.","Complex hydrides; Destabilization; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation/dehydrogenation; LiBH<sub>4</sub>","Alkali metals; Dehydrogenation; Desorption; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Light metals; Lithium compounds; Thermodynamics; Complex hydrides; Covalent compounds; Dehydrogenation reactions; Desorption temperatures; Destabilization; Heat of reaction; Hydrogen atoms; Hydrogen densities; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen storage capacities; Hydrogen storage materials; ; Lithium borohydride; Metal hydrides; Reversible reaction; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Storage densities; boron; chemical binding; desorption; hydrogen; literature review; lithium; thermodynamics; Hydrogen storage"

Multi-component metal hydrides belong to one of the promising categories of materials that can potentially offer high hydrogen storage capacity. Despite extensive research on metal hydrides over the past decades, the progress remains limited partly due to the inability of screening a nearly infinite number of possible alloy compositions. High throughput materials fabrication and characterization techniques therefore offer an advantage in studying multi-component alloys and their phase transition to metal hydrides. We fabricated an Mg-Ni-Al and Ca-B-Ti ternary alloy libraries using a continuous combinatorial material synthesis technique, and measured the optical reflectance to examine the formation of metal hydride phase when the alloy library was exposed to hydrogen. The results indicate that mapping the change in reflectance is a viable method to study the kinetics of hydride formation. Monitoring the optical properties provides evidence for the ""black state"" formed during the transition from α-phase to β-phase. In addition, we found that the fastest reflectance change occurred when the alloy has an Mg to Ni ratio of approximately 2:1, and with low concentration of Al. © 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.

Below 250 °C, the alanate decomposes into Al, LiH and H2, through the formation of Li3AlH6, whereas the amide remains largely intact. The release of gaseous hydrogen corresponds to approximately 5 wt%. Above 250 °C, additional ∼4 wt% of hydrogen is produced through solid-state reactions among LiNH2, LiH and metallic Al, through the formation of intermetallic Li-Al binary alloy and an unidentified intermediate. The overall reaction of the thermochemical transformation of the LiAlH 4-LiNH2 mixture results in the production of Li 3AlN2, metallic Al, LiH and the release of 9 wt% of gaseous hydrogen. The reaction mechanism of the thermal decomposition is different from one identified earlier during mechanical treatment of the same system. Rehydrogenation of the thermally-decomposed products of LiAlH 4-LiNH2 mixture using high hydrogen pressure (180 bar) and heating (275 °C) yields LiNH2 and amorphous aluminum nitride (AlN). © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

For both the (nLiAlH 4+LiNH2) and (LiAlH4+5 wt.% nanometric Fe) composites the second constituent strongly destabilizes LiAlH4 during milling by different mechanisms. For (nLiAlH4+MnCl2) two concurrent mechanisms are observed: (i) a reaction between both constituents during ball milling leading to the formation of LiCl, amorphous Mn and H2, and (ii) a catalytic-like induced decomposition of LiAlH4 into Li 3AlH6, Al and H2. For the (LiNH 2+nMgH2; n=0.5-2.0) composite system, the pathway of hydride reactions depends on the molar ratio n and total milling energy consumed during ball milling.

Much effort has gone into understanding the rate-limiting processes in its hydrogen release and absorption reactions. The diffusion of metal species has been suggested as a possible kinetic bottleneck in Ti-doped materials. In this paper, we outline an approach for calculating the diffusivity of defects in complicated lattices using a combination of first-principles density-functional theory calculations and stochastic kinetic Monte Carlo methods. We apply this methodology to the diffusion of metal defects in NaAlH4 and Na3AlH 6 that have been predicted to exist in large concentrations. We find that of the metal defects that exist in the largest concentrations, a neutral AlH3 vacancy is the most mobile in NaAlH4 (ΔH mig = 0.34 eV, D0 = 1.30 × 10-2 cm 2/s, and DT=400K = 7.55 × 10-7 cm 2/s) and that a negatively charged Na vacancy is the most mobile in Na3AlH6 (ΔHmig = 0.33 eV, D0 = 6.67 × 10-3 cm2/s, and DT=400K = 4.96 × 10-7 cm2/s). At T = 400 K, the calculated diffusion rates are an order of magnitude lower for charged AlH4 vacancies in NaAlH4 (ΔH = 0.44 eV, D0 = 1.41 × 10-2 cm2/s, and DT=400K = 3.92 × 10 -8 cm2/s) and charged Na vacancies in NaAlH4 (ΔH = 0.43 eV, D0 = 2.96 × 10-3 cm 2/s, and DT=400K = 1.19 × 10-8 cm 2/s).

During the evaluation period the only maintenance work was changing the lubricating oil of the engine once a year, and reactivating the metal hydride powder by external heating after an accidental inlet of air into the reservoir. There occurred no technical failure, and there was no safety incident, neither during operation nor during recharging of hydrogen.

The research results indicate that microstructural refinement (particle and grain size) induced by ball milling influences quite modestly the hydrogen storage properties of simple metal and complex metal hydrides. On the other hand, the addition of nanometric elemental metals acting as potent catalysts and/or metal halide catalytic precursors brings about profound improvements in the hydrogen absorption/desorption kinetics for simple metal and complex metal hydrides alike. In general, catalytic precursors react with the hydride matrix forming a metal salt and free nanometric or amorphous elemental metals/intermetallics which, in turn, act catalytically. However, these catalysts change only kinetic properties i.e. the hydrogen absorption/desorption rate but they do not change thermodynamics (e.g., enthalpy change of hydrogen sorption reactions). It is shown that a complex metal hydride, LiAlH4, after high energy ball milling with a nanometric Ni metal catalyst and/or MnCl2 catalytic precursor, is able to desorb relatively large quantities of hydrogen at RT, 40 and 80 °C. This kind of behavior is very encouraging for the future development of solid state hydrogen systems. © 2010 by the authors.","Ball milling; Microstructural refinement; Nano-catalytic additives; Particle/grain size; Simple metal and complex hydrides; Solid state hydrogen storage","Additives; Ball milling; Chlorine compounds; Hydrides; Lithium compounds; Manganese compounds; Metal halides; Metals; Milling (machining); Nanocatalysts; Thermodynamics; Catalytic additives; Complex hydrides; High-energy ball milling; Hydrogen absorption/desorption kinetics; Hydrogen storage properties; Microstructural refinement; Military University of Technology; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Hydrogen storage"

In some instances, these materials are sensitive to the environment surrounding the material and the behavior is unique and independent to each material. The development of testing procedures to evaluate a material's behavior with different environmental exposures is a critical need. In some cases material modifications may be needed in order to reduce the risk of environmental exposure.

The results of these and other UN tests are shown for ammonia borane, NH 3BH 3, and alane, AlH 3. The burn rate test showed a strong dependence on the preparation method of aluminum hydride as the particle size and trace amounts of solvent greatly influence the test results.

It is clear that the key challenge in developing this technology is hydrogen storage. Current methods for hydrogen storage have yet to meet all the demands for onboard applications. High-pressure gas storage or liquefaction cannot fulfill the storage criteria required for on-board storage. Solid-state materials have shown potential advantages for hydrogen storage in comparison to other storage methods. In this article, the most popular solid-state storage materials and methods including carbon based materials, metal hydrides, metal organic frameworks, hollow glass microspheres, capillary arrays, clathrate hydrates, metal nitrides and imides, doped polymer and zeolites, are critically reviewed. The survey shows that most of the materials available with high storage capacity have disadvantages associated with slow kinetics and those materials with fast kinetics have issues with low storage capacity. Most of the chemisorption-based materials are very expensive and in some cases, the hydrogen absorption/desorption phenomena isirreversible. Furthermore, a very high temperature is required to release the adsorbed hydrogen. On the other hand, the main drawback in the case of physisorption-based materials and methods is their lower capacity for hydrogen storage, especially under mild operating conditions. To accomplish the requisite goals, extensive research studies are still required to optimize the critical parameters of such systems, including the safety (to be improved), security (to be available for all), cost (to be lowered), storage capacity (to be increased), and the sorption-desorption kinetics (to be improved). © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The hydrogen release temperature, represented by the temperature T1/2 at which the hydrogen release reaction is half completed, decreased by ΔT1/2 = -104 °C for 5 wt% NiCl2 addition and by ΔT1/2 = -112 °C for 11 wt% NiCl2 addition compared to that of additive-free LiB0.33N0.67H2.67. This represents a significant improvement over the maximum temperature reduction of ΔT1/2 = -90 °C achieved previously with Pt/Vulcan carbon additive (Pt nanoparticles supported on a Vulcan carbon substrate). Transmission electron microscopy on LiB0.33N0.67H2.67 + 11 wt% NiCl2 revealed uniformly dispersed nanoparticles with diameters less than 8 nm within the LiB0.33N0.67H2.67 matrix, consistent with reduction of the NiCl2 to metallic Ni during synthesis by ball milling.

However, its compact, efficient, and safe storage is an unresolved issue. One of the main options is solid-state storage in hydrides. Unfortunately, no binary metal hydride satisfies all requirements regarding storage density and hydrogen release and uptake. Increasingly complex hydride systems are investigated, but high thermodynamic stabilities as well as slow kinetics and poor reversibility are important barriers for practical application. Nanostructuring by ball-milling is an established method to reduce crystallite sizes and increase reaction rates. Since five years attention has also turned to alternative preparation techniques that enable particle sizes below 10 nanometers and are often used in conjunction with porous supports or scaffolds. In this Review we discuss the large impact of nanosizing and -confinement on the hydrogen sorption properties of metal hydrides. We illustrate possible preparation strategies, provide insight into the reasons for changes in kinetics, reversibility and thermodynamics, and highlight important progress in this field. All in all we provide the reader with a clear view of how nanosizing and -confinement can beneficially affect the hydrogen sorption properties of the most prominent materials that are currently considered for solid-state hydrogen storage. Light metal hydrides are an important option for compact, safe, and efficient on-board hydrogen storage. However, slow kinetics, poor reversibility, and low equilibrium pressures hamper their practical application. We review the impact of nanosizing and -confinement; recent strategies with a large impact on the hydrogen sorption properties of relevant light metal hydrides.

Fast H-sorption kinetics at around 300 °C can be achieved after processing Mg-based mixtures by high energy ball milling (HEBM), which produces nanostructured composite powders. Severe plastic deformation (SPD) processing techniques are being explored as an alternative to HEBM in order to obtain more air-resistant materials and to reduce the time and energy required for processing. In this paper, MgH2 and MgH2-Fe mixtures were severely mechanically processed by extensive cold forging (CF) and cold rolling (CR). A very significant grain refinement (up to 10 nm) was achieved, which is comparable to the values typically obtained after processing by HEBM. Enhanced H-sorption properties were observed for these mechanically processed MgH 2-based nanocomposites in comparison with commercial magnesium hydride. The obtained compacts after CR and CF presents a much lower specific surface area than the ball-milled powders and therefore show higher air-resistance.

Even in the simplest MH, i.e. alkali hydrides (Alk-H), some trends in physical properties, and especially their deviations, are not well understood. Similar doubts exist for the alkaline-earth hydride (AlkE-H) series, and are even more pronounced for complex systems, like transition metal-doped AlkE-H, alanates and borohydrides. This work is an attempt of explaining some trends in the physical properties of Alk-H and AlkE-H, employing the Bader analysis of the charge distribution topology evaluated by first-principle all-electron calculations. These results are related to some variables commonly used in the explanation of experimental and calculated results, and are also accompanied by simple tight-binding estimations. Such an approach provides a valuable insight in the characteristics of M-H and H-H interactions in these hydrides, and their possible changes along with external parameters, like temperature, pressure, defect or impurity introduction.

Important reaction steps take place at the very surface of the solid during hydrogen absorption. Since these reaction steps are drastically influenced by the properties and potential contamination of the solid, it is very important to understand the characteristics of the surface, and a variety of analytical methods are required to achieve this. In this work, a TiMn2-type metal hydride alloy is investigated by means of high-pressure activation measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), secondary neutral mass spectrometry (SNMS) and thermal desorption mass spectrometry (TDMS). In particular, TDMS is an analytical tool that, in contrast to SIMS or SNMS, allows the hydrogen content in a metal to be quantified. Furthermore, it allows the activation energy for desorption to be determined from TDMS profiles; the method used to achieve this is presented here in detail. In the results section, it is shown that the oxide layer formed during manufacture and long-term storage prevents any hydrogen from being absorbed, and so an activation process is required. XPS measurements show the oxide states of the main alloy elements, and a layer 18 nm thick is determined via SNMS. Furthermore, defined oxide layers are produced and characterized in UHV using XPS. The influence of these thin oxide layers on the hydrogen sorption process is examined using TDMS. Finally, the activation energy of desorption is determined for the investigated alloy using the method presented here, and values of 46 kJ/mol for hydrogen sorbed in UHV and 103 kJ/mol for hydrogen originating from the manufacturing process are obtained. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Activation energy; Hydrogen detection; Metal hydrides; Oxygen adsorption; Surface analysis; Surface contamination; Thermal desorption","Absorption; Activation analysis; Activation energy; Alloys; Cerium alloys; Gas adsorption; High performance liquid chromatography; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Lithium batteries; Mass spectrometers; Metal analysis; Metals; Oxygen; Pollution detection; Secondary ion mass spectrometry; Spectrometry; Spectrum analysis; Surface chemistry; Thermal desorption; Ultrahigh vacuum; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Activation measurements; Activation process; Alloy elements; Analytical investigations; Analytical methods; Analytical tools; Complex surfaces; Desorption process; Hydrogen absorptions; Hydrogen contents; Hydrogen detection; Hydrogen sorptions; Long-term storages; Manufacturing process; Metal hydride alloys; Metal hydrides; Oxide layers; Oxygen adsorption; Reaction steps; Secondary neutral mass spectrometries; Storage densities; Surface contamination; Thermal desorption mass spectrometries; Thin oxide layers; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies; Xps; Xps measurements; Surface analysis"

In contrast, no H 2 desorption is observed during low energy milling of LiAlH 4 containing n-Fe. Similarly, no H 2 desorption occurs during high energy ball milling for LiAlH 4 containing micrometric Fe (μ-Fe) and, for comparison, both the micrometric and nanometric Ni (μ-Ni and n-Ni) additive. X-ray diffraction studies show that ball milling results in a varying degree of the lattice expansion of LiAlH 4 for both the Fe and Ni additives. A volumetric lattice expansion larger than 1% results in the profound destabilization of LiAlH 4 accompanied by continuous H 2 desorption during milling according to reaction: LiAlH 4 (solid) → 1/3Li 3AlH 6 + 2/3Al + H 2. It is hypothesized that the Fe ions are able to dissolve in the lattice of LiAlH 4 by the action of mechanical energy, replacing the Al ions and forming a substitutional solid solution. The quantity of dissolved metal ions depends primarily on the total energy of milling per unit mass of powder generated within a prescribed milling time, the type of additive ion e.g. Fe vs. Ni and on the particle size (micrometric vs. nanometric) of metal additive. For thermal dehydrogenation the average apparent activation energy of Stage I (LiAlH 4 (solid) → 1/3Li 3AlH 6 + 2/3Al + H 2) is reduced from the range 76 to 96 kJ/mol for the μ-Fe additive to about 60 kJ/mol for the n-Fe additive. For Stage II dehydrogenation (1/3Li 3AlH 6 → LiH+1/3Al + 0.5H 2) the average apparent activation energy is within the range 77-93 kJ/mol, regardless of the particle size of the Fe additive (μ-Fe vs. n-Fe). The n-Fe and n-Ni additives, the latter used for comparison, provide nearly identical enhancement of dehydrogenation rate during isothermal dehydrogenation at 100 °C. Ball milled (LiAlH 4 + 5 wt.% n-Fe) slowly self-discharges up to ∼5 wt.% H 2 during storage at room temperature (RT), 40 and 80 °C. Fully dehydrogenated (LiAlH 4 + 5 wt.% n-Fe) has been partially rehydrogenated up to 0.5 wt.% H 2 under 100 bar/160°C/24 h.

However, its practical use is hampered by its high thermodynamic stability and slow H-exchange kinetics. In the present work, the effects of Ti-based additives, including Ti, TiH 2, and TiF 3, on the dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation of NaBH 4 (NaH+B) were investigated. It was revealed that all of the titanium-based additives were effective in improving the hydrogen desorption and absorption reactions of NaBH 4, and, among them, TiF 3 possessed the highest catalytic activity. The whole dehydrogenation process for the NaBH 4-0.05TiF 3 sample can be regarded as a two-step process: (i) a preferential reaction (3NaBH 4 + TiF 3 → 3NaF + TiB 2 + B + 6H 2) occurring at around 300 °C, and (ii) the formation of Ti- and F-containing species catalyze the dehydrogenation of the remaining NaBH 4. It was also indicated that the F anion can substitute for anionic H in NaH to form NaF 1-xH x in the case of NaH-B-0.05TiF 3 during the hydrogenation process. Therefore, the observed promotion effect of TiF 3 on the reversible dehydrogenation of NaBH 4 should be understood as arising from the combined effects of active Ti- and F-containing species. Also, FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of amorphous Na 2B 12H 12, in both the dehydrogenated and the rehydrogenated states, which may play a role in the partial dehydrogenation and reversibility observed in NaBH 4 with and without catalyst doping. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","","Catalyst activity; Dehydrogenation; Desorption; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Hydrogen; Sodium; Titanium; Absorption reactions; Candidate materials; Combined effect; FTIR spectroscopy; Hydrogen contents; Hydrogen desorption; Hydrogenation process; Preferential reaction; Promotion effects; Rehydrogenation; Reversible dehydrogenation; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Titanium-based; Two-step process; Hydrogen storage"

However, the motorcycles' emissions are the main moving air pollution sources. Therefore, it's important to develop more efficient combustion technology in order to save energy and reduce air pollution. In this paper, a novel technology of hydrogen-gasoline compound fuel is developed. Hydrogen gas is released from solid state hydrogen storage tank and then mixed with the incoming gasoline. The intake valve in manifold sucks the hydrogen-gasoline compound fuel into the cylinder for combustion. A series of performance test is conducted by motorcycle chassis dynamometers. The results reveal that this technology can increase the power and torque, and decrease fuel consumption per kilo-power due to promote combustion efficiency. In addition, the hydrogen has greater heat value, so the oil temperature and sparkplug temperature increase. This technique can reduce CO and HC, but increase CO2 and NOx. The engine performance is improved at rarefied hydrogen-gasoline compound fuel. Therefore, the engine performance with M.J. #98 is better than that with M.J. #110. This technique can achieve energy saving and environment-friendly purpose.

Alfa Aesar LiAlH4 powder investigated in this work has the average particle size of 9.9 ± 5.2 μm as compared to 50-150 μm for Sigma-Aldrich LiAlH4 investigated by Ares et al. [9]. High energy ball milling reduced the particle size of the present LiAlH4 to 2.8 ± 2.3 μm. In general, comparing the results of our microstructural studies with those reported by Ares et al. [9] it is clear that the morphology, microstructure and chemistry of LiAlH4 can be very dissimilar depending on the supplier from which LiAlH4 powder was purchased. We do not observe a partial decomposition of LiAlH4 during milling up to 5 h under high energy impact mode. The observed melting of LiAlH4 in a DSC test is a very volatile event where the liquid LiAlH4 starts foaming and flowing out of the alumina crucible. After completion of solidification and desorption at temperatures above melting the powder resembles a lava rock. A thermal sectioning in DSC tests at pre-determined temperatures and subsequent XRD studies show that LiAlH4 starts decomposing into Li 3AlH6 immediately after melting. Li3AlH 6 seems to be already solidified before it starts decomposing in the next stage. All volumetric desorption curves at the 120-300 °C range clearly exhibit a two-stage desorption process, Stage I and II. As received LiAlH 4 is able, in a fully solid state, to desorb at 120 °C under pressure of 0.1 MPa H2 (atmospheric) as much as 7.1 wt.%H2 within ∼259,000 s (∼72 h), i.e. ∼93% of the purity-corrected H 2 content from the reactions in Stage I (LiAlH4(s) → (1/3)Li3AlH6(s) + (2/3)Al(s) + H2) and Stage II ((1/3)Li3AlH6(s) → LiH + (1/3)Al + 0.5H 2). The apparent activation energy for Stage I and II for unmilled LiAlH4 is equal to ∼111 and ∼100 kJ/mol, respectively. For the ball milled LiAlH4 the apparent activation energy for Stage I and II is slightly lower ∼92.5 and ∼92 kJ/mol, respectively. The water absorption up to 11.7% due to exposure to air for 1 h does not change in any drastic way the hydrogen desorption rate of ball milled LiAlH4 in Stage I. Flammability tests show that the ball milled LiAlH4 powder does not self-ignite on contact with air but can only be ignited by scraping the cylinder walls with a metal tool and then the powder burns with an open flame. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The Gd-containing phase was obtained only after annealing the ball-milled mixture. Additionally, a solvent extracted sample of Gd(BH 4) 3 was studied to gain insight into the transformation from Gd(BH 4) 3 to LiGd(BH 4) 3Cl. The novel compounds were investigated using in situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis combined with mass spectroscopy, Sieverts measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The two new compounds, LiLa(BH 4) 3Cl and LiGd(BH 4) 3Cl, have high lithium ion conductivities of 2.3 ×10 -4 and 3.5 ×10 -4 S•cm -1 (T = 20 °C) and high hydrogen densities of ρ m = 5.36 and 4.95 wt % H 2, and both compounds crystallize in the cubic crystal system (space group I-43m) with unit cell parameter a = 11.7955(1) and a = 11.5627(1) Å, respectively. The structures contain isolated tetranuclear anionic clusters [M 4Cl 4(BH 4) 12] 4- with distorted cubane M 4Cl 4 cores M = La or Gd. Each lanthanide atom coordinates three chloride ions and three borohydride groups, thus completing the coordination environment to an octahedron. The Li + ions are disordered on 2/3 of the 12d Wyckoff site, which agrees well with the very high lithium ion conductivities. The conductivity is purely ionic, as electronic conductivities were measured to only 1.4 ×10 -8 and 9 ×10 -8 S•cm -1 at T = 20 °C for LiLa(BH 4) 3Cl and LiGd(BH 4) 3Cl, respectively.

Hydrogen with molecular weight of 2.016 g/mol and high chemical energy per mass equal to 142 MJ/kg has clearly emerged as an alternative to hydrocarbon fuels. Means for safe and cost effective storage are needed for widespread usage of hydrogen as a fuel. Chemical storage is the one of the safer ways to store hydrogen compared to compressed and liquefied hydrogen. It involves storing hydrogen in chemical bonds in molecules and materials where an on-board reaction is used to release hydrogen. Ammonia-borane, (AB, H 3N·BH3) with a potential capacity of 19.6 wt% is considered a very promising solid state hydrogen storage material. It is thermally stable at ambient temperatures. There are two major routes for the generation of H2 from AB: catalytic hydrolysis/alcoholysis and catalytic thermal decomposition. There has been a flurry of research activity on the generation of H2 from AB recently. The present review deals with an overview of our efforts in developing cost-effective nanocatalysts for hydrogen generation from ammonia borane in protic solvents.","","Ammonia; Bond strength (chemical); Cost effectiveness; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen bonds; Hydrogen storage; Pyrolysis; Reaction kinetics; Ambient temperatures; Ammonia borane; Chemical energy; Chemical storage; Cost effective; Hydrocarbon fuel; Hydrogen generations; Nanocatalysts; Potential capacity; Protic solvents; Renewable energy source; Research activities; Solid-state hydrogen storage; Thermal decompositions; Thermally stable; Hydrogen production"

The measured parameters include maximum deflagration pressure rise, maximum rate of pressure rise, minimum ignition temperature, minimum ignition energy and minimum explosible concentration. The calculated explosion indexes include volume-normalized maximum rate of pressure rise (KSt), explosion severity (ES) and ignition sensitivity (IS). The deflagration parameters of Pittsburgh seam coal dust and Lycopodium spores (reference materials) are also measured. The results show that activated carbon is the safest hydrogen storage media among the examined materials. Ammonia borane is unsafe to use because of the high explosibility of its dust. The core insights of this contribution are useful for quantifying the risks associated with use of these materials for on-board systems in light-duty fuel cell-powered vehicles and for supporting the development of hydrogen safety codes and standards.

Aggregate formation in solution was investigated via UV-visible spectroscopy at different pH ranges. At neutral to basic conditions, porphyrin pairs formed partially soluble hetero H-aggregates and at low pH, soluble homo J-aggregates was formed. H-aggregates were isolated by centrifuging and freeze-drying. The obtained solids were studied by X-ray powder diffraction. Thermal stability of dry aggregates was determined by thermogravimetric analysis. The TCPP-TAP hetero aggregates exhibited hydrogen uptake between 80 °C and 250 °C.

Cycling of hydrogen for 1.5 times results in transformation of these initially different Ti compounds into similar compounds, whose composition is dependent on the temperature. Thus, if low temperatures were used during the cycling process (up to 175 °C) an amorphous Al-Ti alloy formed, while upon using high temperatures (200 °C and higher) Ti was present as an AlxTi intermetallic.

Under proper steady state conditions, this layer is moving into the bulk metal, retaining constant thickness and velocity. In this work, the kinetics of the moving hydride layer is analyzed, using a model combining the four main sequential steps: adsorption (chemisorption), penetration, diffusion and reaction, in which the hydrogen is transferred from the gas phase into the reaction site. The model yields the rate of absorption during the steady state hydriding process (proportional to the hydride layer velocity) as a function of the pressure, the rate constants of the system (adsorption, desorption, penetration, decomposition, diffusion and interface emission) and the critical concentrations of hydrogen in the hydride, Cmax, Cp and Cmin (the last is associated with the equilibrium absorption pressure Peq). According to the model, for sufficiently high pressures, the rate is pressure-independent. A simple expression for the pressure independent rate is derived. The conditions leading to rates limited by one of the four sequential steps are analyzed and demonstrated. Relatively simple expressions are derived for the rate's pressure dependence. It is shown that for the interface and diffusion controlled cases the general pressure dependence is of the form: Rate-1∝[(P/Peq)1/2-1]-1. For the adsorption controlled case the pressure dependence is Rate∝(P-Peq). Based on the model, a numerical procedure is proposed for a system, removed from an initial steady state, describing the time-dependent approach to the new steady state determined by the applied change. The model is successfully tested for a real case, the uranium-hydrogen system, which is shown to obey the interface control rate equations.","","Chemisorption; Decomposition; Desorption; Diffusion in solids; Gas absorption; Gas adsorption; Interfaces (materials); Point defects; Pressure effects; Rate constants; Hydrogen storage materials; Interstitial alloys; Metal hydrides; Hydrides"

In the sequential mode the milling vial was periodically opened under a protective gas and samples of the milled powder were extracted for microstructural examination whereas during continuous CRMA the vial was never opened up to 270 h duration. MgO was detected by XRD in sequentially milled powders while no MgO was detected in the continuously milled powder. The abundance of the nanostructured ternary complex hydride Mg 2FeH6, produced during sequential milling, and estimated from DSC reached ∼44 wt.% after 188 h, and afterwards it slightly decreased to ∼42 wt.% after 210 and 270 h. In contrast, the DSC yield of Mg 2FeH6 after continuous CRMA for 270 h was ∼57 wt.%. Much higher yield after continuous milling is attributed to the absence of MgO. This behavior provides strong evidence that MgO is a primary factor suppressing formation of Mg2FeH6. The DSC hydrogen desorption onset temperatures are close to 200 °C while the desorption peak temperatures for all powders are below 300 °C and the desorption process is completed within the range 10-20 min. Within the investigated nanograin size range of ∼5-13 nm, the DSC desorption onset and peak temperatures of β-MgH2 and Mg2FeH6 do not exhibit any trend with nanograin (crystallite) size of hydrides. TPD hydrogen desorption peaks from the powders containing a single ternary complex hydride Mg2FeH6, are very narrow, which indicates the presence of small but well-crystallized hydride particles. Their narrowness provides good evidence that the phase composition, bulk hydrogen distribution and hydride particle size distribution are very homogeneous. The overall amount of hydrogen desorbed in TPD from single-hydride Mg2FeH6 powders is somewhat higher than that observed in DSC and TGA desorption. The powder milled sequentially for 270 h and desorbed in a Sieverts-type apparatus at 250 and 290 °C, yielded about a half of the hydrogen content obtained during DSC and TGA tests. No desorption of hydrogen was detected in a Sieverts-type apparatus at 250 and 290 °C after 128 and 70 min, respectively, from the powder continuously milled for 270 h.

It was a project developed through a public/private partnership involving several leading technological and industrial organizations, with primary funding by the Department of Energy (DOE). The primary goals of the project were to gain valuable information on the technical readiness and economic viability of hydrogen fueled buses and to enhance the public awareness and acceptance of emerging hydrogen technologies. The bus completed its field-testing and was placed into public service on September 4, 1998 by Augusta Public Transit in Augusta, Georgia. The bus employs a hybrid Internal Combustion (IC) engine/generator and battery powered electric drive system, with onboard storage of hydrogen in metal hydride beds. The initial operating results demonstrated an overall energy efficiency (miles/BTU) twice the range of a similar diesel-fueled bus, while doubling the range of an all-electric vehicle by providing in-transit recharging of the batteries. Subsequent data showed that the power controller was not optimized for maximum battery life and, therefore, some efficiency was lost. Correction of that condition would provide a daily range of at least 120 miles in a hybrid hydrogen/electric-operating mode. The project developed reduced engine tail-pipe emissions, with NOx measured at less than 0.2 ppm. In addition todemonstrating the inherent safety of a solid-state hydrogen storage system, the project also addressed permit, liability, and safety issues, including a safety risk assessment of the metal hydride storage system. State-of-the-art technology in battery system management was likewise demonstrated.

Both methods demonstrate that in hydrogen storage cycles (Eq. (1)) the majority phases involved are NaAlH4, Na3AlH6, Al and NaH. Only traces of other, as yet unidentified phases are observed, one of which has been tentatively assigned to an Al-Ti alloy on the basis of XRD analysis. The unsatisfactory hydrogen storage capacities heretofore observed in cycle tests are shown to be due entirely to the reaction of Na3AlH6 with Al and hydrogen to NaAlH4 (Eq. (1), 2nd hydrogenation step) being incomplete. Using XRD and NMR methods it has been shown that a higher level of rehydrogenation can be achieved by adding an excess of Al powder. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

GM and Sandia, a National Nuclear Security Administration lab, have embarked on a four year, $10 million program for the project. Researchers also hope to create a tank design that could be adaptable to any type of solid-state hydrogen storage. The project will be conducted in two phases: in phase one, the program will study engineering designs for a sodium alanate storage tank, and in phase two, the promising tank designs will be subjected to rigourous testing, after that fabrication of the storage tanks will be done.","","Contracts; Fuels; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Research; Storage; Storage Tanks; Fuel storage; Fuel tanks; Hydrides; Hydrogen fuels; Industrial research; Project management; General Motors (GM) Corp.

Hydrogen represents an important option also to store energy in a long term scenario of fluctuating power generation from renewables sources (solar and wind). However, independently from the primary energy sources used for its production in medium and long term (fossil fuel with carbon dioxide sequestration, nuclear, renewables), R&D efforts must be focused henceforward on hydrogen related technologies, like fuel cells and advanced storage systems. Fuel cells, in particular, represent the ideal system to convert the hydrogen chemical energy into electricity with high efficiencies. The CESI experience on a grid connected PEFC system fuelled with hydrogen stored in metal hydrides is outlined in this presentation with emphasis on all the aspects related to subsystem interlacing. A 6,5 Nm3 capacity hydrogen storage was developed at CESI starting from commercial metal hydride powders supplied by LabTech Ltd. The heat transfer during the charge - discharge cycles and the useful hydrogen output were optimised in view of the coupling with a PEFC stack/module operating near ambient pressure. Three Independence 1000 PEFC modules were supplied by ReliOn and carefully characterised at CESI laboratories. This module is a rather open system and a lot of parameters can be acquired at operating conditions including all the cell and cartridges voltages, currents and temperatures. The module responses to an external electric load were investigated both in steady state conditions, by increasing gradually the load, and during steep load changes. The actual hydrogen consumption was measured at different operating conditions and LHV and HHV efficiencies were obtained as a function of the power output. The PEFC modules were connected to the local grid through a 3.3 kW DC-AC converter (inverter) that was supplied by SGS Future based on CESI specifications. The inverter efficiency exceeded 90%. A control system was set up in a LabVIEW™ environment to manage the hydrogen storage charge and discharge cycles and to test the PEFC - inverter system behaviour on different load profiles. Experimental results on the integrated system are presented and discussed. A few critical aspects related to each subsystem and to their interfaces are analysed This work was carried out in the frame of the research on the Italian Electrical System ""Ricerca di Sistema"", Ministerial Decrees of January 26, 2000 and April 17, 2001.","","Carbon dioxide; Energy storage; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Renewable energy resources; Solid oxide fuel cells; Energy vector; Fossil fuel resources; Metal hydrides; Primary energy sources; Fossil fuels"

In practice, however, hydrogen storage alloys alternate hydrogen absorption and desorption processes ceaselessly. Therefore, in functional situations where hydrogen storage alloys are utilized, their hydrogen absorption properties cannot be evaluated precisely by applying the results of observations made under equilibrium states. We assessed the hydrogen absorption behavior and phase transformation of LaNi 5 during the hydrogen absorption process using our newly developed time-resolved in-situ XRD system for vapor-solid phase reaction. This system, which comprises a chamber for performing in-situ XRD measurements, a Sieverts' component for measuring hydrogenation speed, and a PSPC (position-sensitive proportional counter) X-ray detector, enables sequential XRD measurement in an in-situ atmosphere. Over a period of several minutes, we observed the phase transformation of the master alloy of LaNi 5 into a hydride of LaNi 5H 6 during the hydrogen absorption process and evaluated the process sequentially at intervals of a few seconds. Our results showed that the actual phase transformation during the process of hydrogen storage differs from what had been characterized previously under an equilibrium state. It was also made clear that the lattice volume of the hydride produced remains unchanged between the onset of hydride formation and attainment of the equilibrium state. © 2005 The Japan Institute of Metals.","In-situ; LaNi <sub>5</sub> ; Metal hydride; Phase transformation; Time-resolved","Absorption; Crystal structure; Desorption; Hydration; Hydrogen; Phase transitions; X ray diffraction analysis; In-situ; LaNi5; Metal hydrides; Time-resolved; Lanthanum compounds"
